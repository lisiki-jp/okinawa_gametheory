# Author's Note 

I wrote this entire report in a kitchen, standing, because I'm too broke to buy a desk. 
And I find this is a pretty great place for writing. I can stack pots to adjust the height of the laptop. 
I can have a little walk to think without switching between sitting and standing.  
I can feed my energy with food. I can write and analyze while cooking, eating.  
A kitchen is the best place in the world for writing. 
Highly recommended.  

While writing this report, I realized that e-Stat is so outdated. This isn't real transparency.  
We need a 'Right to Know' law like Sweden's. But more importantly, we need to stop being passive. Politicians won't fix this because it doesn't benefit them. It benefits us.  
We pay the taxes. We own the data. We have the right to know.  
Stop trusting them blindly. They have a reason to hide the data.

So you can see the edit history. I likely will fix small errors after the publication(v1.0).
Also, pull requests are welcome. Although I can't guarantee my response. Because I'm not active online. 
Even if your request didn't get merged, it shows your response to my report; fellow readers will see it and get a more diverse analysis.

I invented the CAE model (Percieved Capability model, Cp = Ap - Ep) while analyzing Okinawa.  
And I think the idea is worthy of further polish. Possibly an academic paper, so anyone can use it.  
The model is simple to understand by anyone, it has strong predictive/explanatory power, and can be applied to almost any entity that involves politics. (That means almost anything. Individuals to nations.)
My next writing is likely about the model. I know you aren't interested in. But I'm excited about that idea.  
And I have another plan to write a more dangerous report about the real world. Much impactful than this report. It's truly world-scale. I can't wait to deliver it to you.  
Or I can go with Okinawa stuff with more data if you demand.  

I know Okinawa researchers will not like this report, as Jared Diamond is hated among historians.  
Outsider breaking things.  
The underlying theory is provided by BDM (Political Science/Game Theory), which is thriving internationally, but not in Japan.  
So, Japanese researchers might not like my report.  

I didn't cite academic papers because I couldn't find one.  
Existing research on Okinawa (or Japan) is not based on game theory or political science.  
The papers analysed the economy of Okinawa (or Japan) lacked the breakdown I needed.  
So, I decided that it's faster to gather data and calculate myself.  

I don't have total confidence in the "Future" chapter. 
Because it's fundamentally about predicting the future, which nobody can.  
So I think the chapter needs extensive review from many professionals.  
I wrote it to show a rough idea of how we can improve Okinawa. 
And I know there are difficult problems ahead that I didn't explain in this short report. Okinawa is a big Yubari.  
But we have to face it now, before it's too late.  

Maybe you do not agree with all the things I said. That's great. I want to hear your analysis.  
And I'm sure everyone wants to hear your thoughts.  
This is a necessary process for democracy to work; voters have to think and share their thoughts.  

Maybe you are not sure whether my idea is good, bad, true, or false.  
And that's excellent because I couldn't fit all the important data in this short report. 
You are smart to be cautious. 
If I tried to fit all the data to prove my point, I would have to write an entire book. You don't want to read them.  
So, I focused on logic and narrative in this report. Speed and impact. 
If you are motivated, you can check the fact for yourself.  

Or you can ask LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini) if my report is trustworthy or not. 
Google provides a high-quality LLM for free for developers, but anyone can use it. (https://aistudio.google.com/)
LLM Chatbot is the fastest way to get a rough idea today. 
But be cautious, they don't tell you the truth every time.  
Especially in the environment media is spreading misinformation, LLM often presents you the biased information.  
If you are not sure, ask them a proof of their claim.  

If you liked only some parts of my analysis, just share only those parts. 

If you are a content creator, please make a video or post about this report.  
Even critique is welcome. Go for it.  
That will help Japan. You will save us.  
You can link my report so you can blame me if things go wrong.  

You can copy-paste my theory and claim it yours; I don't mind.  

But please remember my name, because this is not my last report.  
I don't want to swim in SNS algorithm hell again.

# Recommendation: for those who want to think by themselves

I didn't write this report in a vacuum.  
Without the two exceptional minds, I couldn't figure out Okinawa.  

### Bruce Bueno de Mesquita(BDM), professor at New York University: The man who solved politics by math.  
For those who want to know about the scientific analysis of politics, including corporate politics, I recommend "The Logic of Political Survival" by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita.  
It's free and available online.  
* [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227458612_The_Logic_of_Political_Survival](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227458612_The_Logic_of_Political_Survival)   
This research book cited over 6,903 in Google Scholar. The usual citation in this field is under 50. 
This is the foundational research in political science. Must read if you are interested in the scientific analysis of politics.  

He also published the book for a broader audience, "The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics". 
Highly recommended. 
The book is available in Japanese. The translation is substandard. I recommend that you refer to the original if you encounter a part that doesn't make sense.  
The full text of the original book might be on the Online Burma/Myanmar Library, a non-profit website for humanitarian purposes.  
I'm not sure if it's official or not, maybe unauthorized OCR. But good enough for double-checking the translation for free.  

Another free source is CGP Grey's YouTube video "The Rules for Rulers". The video is based on the book.  
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs)  
23M views. I checked, and it's pretty good for introduction.  
It has a Japanese Dub. Click the bottom right cog icon. It's low quality with inconsistent talk speed. But it's good enough if you are motivated.  
You may need to watch it multiple times to understand, because of poor dub quality.  

Btw, truly sophisticated ideas rarely get translated or translated correctly, because the translator needs to have the same knowledge level as the author.  
The ability to read/write English is not enough. 
Translation is a low-paying, non-creative job. Those who possess high skills as an original author prefer more creative, high-paying jobs. 
So, structurally, Japanese readers have a near-zero chance of accessing truly sophisticated foreign ideas with good translation. 

### Perun: the PowerPoint Warrior.  

If you want to understand the reality of Japan's defense without the 'Right vs. Left' 'Peace vs. War' ideology, you must watch Perun.  
He strips away the emotion and asks: 'Does Japan actually have the money and the people to defend itself?'

He is on YouTube, but he is not a YouTuber; he is a professional analyst.  

He is a real craftsman, the kind of person you can't find online. 
Because real professionals are busy in the real world. Not on YouTube.  

But Perun brings that "real world" expertise to us.  

He is an anonymous Australian defense analyst who reportedly works in the government or private sector.  
He has a high reputation among the professionals. 
General Ben Hodges, the former Commanding General of the United States Army Europe, has not only praised the quality of the channel's information but has also appeared as a special guest twice to discuss complex strategic topics.  
It signals that Hodges views Perun's analysis as professional-grade, accurate, and serious enough to warrant his time.  
General Hodges treats Perun not as a "YouTuber," but as a fellow defense professional.  

Perun is considered one of the best in the field of open-source intelligence.  
When he launched his channel, he pledged his Patreon earnings to humanitarian aid for Ukraine.  
His anonymity allows him to speak with a level of dry, professional honesty that you rarely see in public media. 
He doesn't want your 'Likes'; he wants you to understand the reality.  

Why? Because he believes misunderstanding of reality can result in real tragedy. 
He believes Russians, and all of us, overestimated the Russian military based on bad data, which resulted in the Ukraine invasion. 
It was framed as a "3-day operation" at the start of it, and everyone believed it. 
That's why Russia decided to start the invasion, because they thought it would be an easy job.  

The war wouldn't have happened if Russia had known it would last at least 3 years.  
And they can't see the end of it even today. Russians are regretting. If they knew it would last this long, they didn't invade.  

If we understand the cost of war, we are less likely to start one.  
And if defenders prepare for the defense and show that efficiency to the aggressor, the offender will think twice.  

He is trying to make the world safer for everyone by sharing his professional view.  
That's not something he can do by working for a specific government. That's why he is on YouTube.  

I was inspired by him. The single anonymous person is making the world better by sharing analysis.  
That's why I wrote this report.
