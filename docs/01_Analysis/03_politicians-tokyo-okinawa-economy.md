# 3: "Politicians of Tokyo want to improve the economy of Okinawa."

You already know Nagata-cho actually wants the opposite, weak Okinawa. So they can be controlled.  
Here, we will explore **why** they want **absolute** control so badly. 
They are not stupid. They know they could buy 1,000 long-range missiles every year for that money. 
But they choose to weaken Okinawa, why? **What could be worth that amount of missiles?**

You might have guessed it, the bases.  
You could be wrong.  

Nagata-cho's fear is deeper than that.  
The real reason they spent so much to ensure a weak Okinawa is to prevent **Okinawa independence**.  

### Rich = Independence ?: Catalonia case

Have you ever heard of Catalonia?
It's a part of the eastern coast of Spain where the beautiful Mediterranean city of Barcelona is located. Sagrada Família is there.  
And they have the Catalan independence movement.  

The reason? **because they are rich**.  
Because they are rich and pay more taxes than other parts of Spain, they thought that if they got independence, they could pay less tax.  
They even held the referendums on independence. 

And, Catalonia has been Spain for over 600 years. And that was a relatively peaceful process of political marriage.  
Okinawa has been Japan for roughly 150 years, if we count from 1879. The annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom. 

So, if Okinawa becomes rich?
And if they get independence and switch sides?

It's the end of Japan's security. Important trades are going through near Okinawa.  
The entire Pacific becomes a potential war zone because Okinawa is part of the "First Island Chain" that prevents the Chinese fleet from going Pacific.  
Without maritime control, we have no future. We have no food. No oil. No resources. The stock price will vanish in one night. 

This is the fundamental fear of Nagata-cho.  
This is why they want a weak and dependent Okinawa. 

### Preparing for the worst, we end up in a worse position

The ruling party is not only a politician. They are the commander of the military.  
The military has a **duty to prepare for the worst.**
And the worst is "the Okinawa independence" and independent Okinawa switches sides to China.  

This is why. **It's their duty to weaken Okinawa**. Or at least that's what they likely thought.  

**If the world consisted only of Japan. The dependent Okinawa plan is perfect.**
But the world is not only Japan. And we have a **non-democratic China now richer than Japan**.  
50 years ago, the plan might have looked perfect. But today, it looks catastrophic.  
As I explained in "2/Poverty is a hole in our armor", poor citizens are vulnerable to influence from China.  

Nagata-cho succeeded in securing a favorable economic balance between Okinawa and Tokyo by weakening Okinawa. But that's also shifting the economic balance between Okinawa and Beijing.  

Yes, preparing for the worst, Nagata-cho is stepping closer to the worst. 
And during the process, Japan was weakened because it was spending money to weaken Okinawa. While **China got weak Okinawa for free.**

Did Tokyo plan the forever dependency plan 50 years ago? Maybe, maybe not. **It doesn't matter**.  
Nobody in the ruling party will tell you "We had". And they are the only ones who know the truth. 
It might even the LDP doesn't know about this. It's been a long time. The initial members have gone.  

But I'm sure after 2010, when the Aid Curse became the common knowleadge among political elites, Tokyo has been sending aid with the intent.  
Whether it is started intentionally or not, the result is the same. The machine is wasting our money today.  
Bureaucrats in Tokyo are happy because they control the island with money. As long as voters don't notice the mechanism.  
Politicians in Okinawa are happy because they can expoit the anger to win election.  
It is a 'Perfect Crime' where no one has to be the villain, but everyone is an accomplice.  

### Solution: Democracy Armor.  

My solution is this: Make Okinawa love **democracy** and make them wealthy as mainland Japanese.  
What **China will never be able to give Okinawa is democracy**. And we have that. 
Okinawans will never get the majority in geopolitics. **A good democracy that can reflect the minority's will is the only answer** for their prosperity.(This is historically proven; we will learn about it in the history chapter in this report.)  
**We can provide that, and China can't.** 

But currently, we are failing to do that.  

Look at Taiwan. They speak Chinese. But they are fighting fiercely to protect their democracy.  
Because they love democracy. It's precious. It's hard to come by. We often forget that because we luckily have that from birth.  
Also, they are rich; communist China could confiscate their asset. That's unthinkable for Taiwanese.  

People of Okinawa have no great memory of democracy. (Actually, they had been benefiting from it massively.)
They vote for anti-bases, and politicians achieve nothing.  
That's all they know about democracy.  

Because of that, We must give them a memory of a good democracy that actually cares about them and improves their life.  
Okinawa stays in the team democracy if it likes democracy.

And this is why you are reading this. **We are the only ones able to deliver a good democracy for Okinawa**. 
Democracy is about the majority. Okinawa has only 1.2% of the population of Japan. They never get the majority if their interests conflict with other prefectures.  
And they have been **directed to conflict** with other prefectures.  
The only people who can bring a good democracy to Okinawa are mainland Japanese, **you**.  

### Why we stand against Tyrannical China

Besides, if we use democracy as a tool to ignore the minority. How can we stand proud against China?
I'm not satisfied with the phrase "Protect the Status Quo" that politicians love to use. 
What if "Status Quo" is wrong?
We, Japan, need the confidence that we are on the right side. 
After all, how can we say we aren't an American client state that is manipulated to fight against fellow Asians, the Chinese?
We will show China, the USA, and the rest of the world that democracy matters. And the Japanese will matter.  


### Good democracy is what keeps us safe and protected.  
There is a strong positive correlation between egalitarian democracy and Life Expectancy. 

**The Evidence:**
1.  **V-Dem: Interactive Maps**
    *   [https://v-dem.net/data_analysis/MapGraph/](https://v-dem.net/data_analysis/MapGraph/)
    *   *Instruction:* Select "Indicators" and search for **"Egalitarian Democracy Index"** (v2x_egal).  
    *   Egalitarian Democracy Index: "To what extent is the ideal of egalitarian democracy achieved?"  
2.  **Life Expectancy by Country 2025**
    *   [https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/life-expectancy-by-country](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/life-expectancy-by-country)

When you compare the maps, you will see that the "Egalitarian Democracy" score translates almost directly into Life Expectancy. 
You live long because we have a good democracy. 

"Good Democracy" and "Life Expectancy" have a structural relationship. You can refer to the papers (by BDM) I cited at the end of this report.  
In short, a "large winning coalition(functioning democracy)" demands "public goods(life expectancy)", and rulers have to fulfill the demand to stay in power. 
1. A functioning democracy creates a large number of people the ruler has to satisfy to get/stay in power. (the group is called Winning Coalition, or just W) 
2. The ruler has to spend national resources to distribute good things(Public Goods) to them(W) to keep them satisfied. (like health care, social security, a fair economy)
3. Otherwise, oppositions will promise "a better deal" to people, and the ruler loses power.  

This explains why the US has low life expectancy despite its wealth. Because they only have two parties (practically only the two parties are allowed in laws), they don't have to compete with "Good Idea". 
The US politicians are competing in "How bad(how little distribute good things)" they can go. Because that will maximize politicians' share (and corporations that give politicians money through lobbying: legalised bribery).  
They just need to be slightly better than their opponent.  
This structure, with only two entities in the system, is called "Duopoly", which the Okinawa local media is. By a 99.4% share.  

### Bonus: Real democracy and flawed democracy
You can search "Egalitarian component index" in V-DEM. This index acts as a scoreboard for how "Good Things" (resources) are actually distributed.  
*   **The Contrast:** While the US lags, countries like **Japan, Germany, and the Nordic states** score very high.  
*   **The Structure:** These countries have achieved an egalitarian society (and high life expectancy) because their political systems force leaders to serve a larger coalition.  

### Bonus: Nationalism is excuse to not provide real improvement.  
Why does Okinawa have strong "Nationalism"?
Because it lets politicians secure power without distributing any goods. 
The economy has never developed. Politicians have no good thing to provide. Or they don't have to provide because it has strong nationalism.  
The only thing they have to offer is a story that keeps people angry with the outside world. That lets politicians win votes and stay in power. 
Just like Russia does.  

### Bonus: WW2 winners die early. Losers live longer. Because they have to distribute real "good".  
The US, Russia, and China have strong nationalism as "The Winner of WW2". This let them satisfy the people with just a "memory". Rulers can neglect to satisfy it's people.  
Germany, Japan, and Italy had to distribute the real public goods to satisfy it's people, because they have no good memory of Nationalism.  
You can see that the WW2 winners have low scores on the "Egalitarian component index", and all losers have a high score on it.  
The UK and France are between the two groups. Because they are "Officially the winner, but practically the loser" of WW2. Their colonial empire collapsed because of the war.  
Yes, Japanese can live longer than US citizens because we lost WW2.  

Sometimes, people say “The Japanese can't have Nationalism”, like it's a bad thing.
The data shows that having no Nationalism is good for your health. We are lucky to not have one.

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  

* It's a tool for control that is outdated and doesn't fit the current situation.  
* Giving good democracy is the best way to make Okinawa in team democracy. And only you, Japanese, can do that.  
* Democracy is good.
