# 5: "Okinawa local newspaper is on Okinawans' side."

"Okinawa media is on Okinawans' side."  
This is a fantasy.  
You might guess, "Are they secretly on Tokyo's side?"  
If so, it would be fun. But no.  

The truth is, **They are on their own side**.  
They are newspaper companies. 
The profit is their goal.  
Not the liberation of the Okinawa people.  

### Estimation of Okinawa Local Newspaper Market Share: 99.43%

Only morning editions are counted because:
1.  The morning edition is the industry standard for an apples-to-apples comparison.  
2.  Many papers (including the *Okinawa Times* and *Ryukyu Shimpo*) do not have an evening edition.  

**Step 1: Local Okinawan Papers' Circulation**

This data is from the newspapers themselves for Fall 2025.  
*   **Okinawa Times (124,255) & Ryukyu Shimpo(123,638) Combined**: **247,893** copies.  

**Step 2: National Papers' Circulation in Okinawa**

From the *Yomiuri Media Guide 2025-2026* (ABC data, average from 2024/07 - 2024/12).  
*   **Yomiuri Shimbun:** 453
*   **Asahi Shimbun:** 620
*   **Mainichi Shimbun:** 189
*   **Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Nikkei):** 4,091
*   **Sankei Shimbun:** 156
*   **National Papers (Total)**: **5,509** copies.  

**Step 3: Final Okinawa Market Share Calculation**

*   **Total Market Circulation**: 247,893 (Local) + 5,509 (National) = **253,402** copies.  
*   **Local Press Market Share**: (247,893 / 253,402) * 100 = **97.83%**

** Step 4: Battle of Politics (vs. Non-Nikkei Papers) **
Excluded Nikkei because it's not their competitor, as Simpo is a partner of Nikkei. I don't have to probe it because Simpo proved it. 
Nikkei usually only provides economic stories, so it is not an obstacle for the local newspapers to spread political narratives.  

*   **National Papers (without Nikkei)**: 453 + 620 + 189 + 156 = **1,418** copies.  
*   **Total "Political/General" Market**: 247,893 + 1,418 = **249,311** copies.  
*   **Market Share (Local Papers vs. General Nationals)**: (247,893 / 249,311) * 100 = **99.43%**

### The comparison with Tokushima: 99.4% vs. 90.7%

Tokushima is often cited for the strongest local newspaper presence in Japan, excluding Okinawa. (Edit: I realized that, after examining 福井一喜's paper, Kouchi is the second, but the numbers on Kouchi and Tokushima are very close. Okinawa is a sole outlier by a large margin, even if Kouchi is the barometer.)
So I made the same calculations for Tokushima to make things clear. All data is from 読売新聞 MEDIA GUIDE　2025-2026. The same data source that used for the Okinawa estimation. And Tokushima Shinbun is the only local newspaper from Tokushima that is registered in NSK (日本新聞協会).  
**Tokushima Market Share (ABC data, average from 2024/07 - 2024/12)**

*   **Local Paper (Tokushima Shimbun):** 160,577 copies
*   **National Papers (Total):** 6,769 + 7,121 + 1,405 + 6,193 + 1,091 = **22,579** copies
*   **Total Market Circulation:** 160,577 + 22,579 = 183,156 copies
*   **Local Press Market Share:** (160,577 / 183,156) * 100 = **87.68%**

| Metric | Okinawa | Tokushima |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Press Circulation** | **247,893** (Times + Shimpo) | **160,577** (Tokushima Shimbun) |
| **National Press Circulation** | **5,509** (All 5 papers) | **22,579** (All 5 papers) |
| **Total Market Circulation** | **253,402** | **183,156** |
| **Local Press Market Share** | **97.8%** | **87.7%** |
| | | |
| **"Political" Market Share (vs. non-Nikkei nationals)** | **99.4%** | **90.7%*** |

**Comparison conclusion:** The gap is immense. A **90.7%** share in Tokushima is a sign of overwhelming local dominance. But, Tokushima Shinbun still has to compete to some degree. A **99.4%** share in Okinawa is a sign of something else entirely: the near-total exclusion of the mainland Japanese political narrative from the print media landscape.  

### Okinawa local newspaper dominance is an anomaly in Japan.  

The result is 99.4%. If we count Nikkei as the same as other national newspapers, 97.8%.  

You can't see these numbers in other prefectures, and likely anywhere in the world. 
Japan is a country with a strong nationwide newspaper; Yomiuri has a Guinness World Record for circulation. 
In that country with a strong national paper, a prefecture completely wiping out the national papers is unheard of.  

"新聞広告を介した情報流通の地域的差異性 福井一喜 2013" [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jags/6/2/6_141/_article/-char/ja](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jags/6/2/6_141/_article/-char/ja)  
This paper has a graph that shows the Okinawa abnormality.  
The data is a bit old, but I confirmed that the data from ABC (2024) has no big difference from it.  
Other strong local newspaper prefectures hover around 90% share. Ishikawa, Tokushima, and Kouchi are the top 3 if we exclude Okinawa.  
Tokushima Shinbun has a 90.7% political narrative share(excluding Nikkei), for example.  
But you can see Okinawa is on another level. They are playing a different game.  

They are incredibly successful. Other local papers would beg to ask them their secret about how to get the dominance.  

The secret is **this entire conflict**.  
If the problem is gone, their monopoly ends.  

### ABC Data shows the national newspaper presence collapsed after 1993

Before 1995(when the Henoko became a problem), National papers had some share in Okinawa. This is from ABC, 1993 and 2025.  
Asashi was the strongest among national newspapers, likely because of its relatively critical stance against Tokyo.  
But even that, Asahi lost about 75% of its sales after the problem arose.  
You can see Nikkei only lost 8% of its share, while others lost large amounts of their share. Because Nikkei is "compatible" with local newspapers. And national newspapers are imcompatible with local newspaper narratives.
Don't be distracted by another bait that claims "logistics to deliver newspapers is difficult". As Nikkei in 1993 had no partnership with Simpo on local production(started on 2008), and still had large sales, that claim is false or too weak. 

| Newspaper | 1993 Circulation (Morning Edition) | 2024 Circulation (Morning Edition) | Change (1993-2024) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Yomiuri Shimbun** (読売新聞) | 665 | 453 | **-212** |
| **Asahi Shimbun** (朝日新聞) | 2,349 | 620 | **-1,729** |
| **Mainichi Shimbun** (毎日新聞) | 532 | 189 | **-343** |
| **Nikkei** (日本経済新聞) | 4,463 | 4,091 | **-372** |
| **Sankei Shimbun** (産経新聞) | 341 | 156 | **-185** |
| **Total** | **8,350** | **5,509** | **-2,841** |

The combined circulation of these four papers fell by **2,469 copies**, a staggering decrease of **nearly 64%**.  

It was a gold rush. It was a gift from god. Or from the American soldiers.  
They got the righteous casus belli to eradicate their competitors.  

### Under the 99.4% narrative monopoly

Local newspapers become the only truth in Okinawa. 
To stand against them, you hate Okinawa.  

They have total authority about **"What Okinawa is"**
Even the governor doesn't dares to challenge them. 

The governor who tried to solve the problem was branded as a "traitor" by them. And he lost his political life.  
"Okinawa Vision" was the governor's initiative to gain economic independence for Okinawa. Theoretically, from the governor's perspective, this could solve the Okinawa problem. 
His name is Hirokazu Nakaima. Who was(is) portrayed as "Traitor" by local media. Local media demanded his resignation. And he is known as "Traitor" among people of Okinawa today, despite his sincere attempts to solve the struggle.  

After him, only hardliner anti-base politicians get the position, who perform symbolic but useless acts. 
It became just a show that the governor appeals to the anti-base voters that he is doing his job.  
They are actors who follow the local newspaper's script.  

And because the conflict gives them this level of narrative control power and market dominance, their business strategy is centered around **How to make conflict alive forever**.  
That's why they make **impossible** demands. They know it's impossible to remove all bases, and that's the point. The demand makes conflict alive forever.  
They love to promote the narrative of "Okinawa vs Japan" that is structurally unwinnable under democracy.  
Yes, they actually don't want bases to be removed.  
It's a rational corporate strategy.  

### Not only newspapers. TV and the governor are owned by them.  

And TV.  
In Okinawa, there are three commercial TV broadcasters. They are not independent; they are family with the newspapers.  
Okinawa Television has a strong tie with Okinawa Times. Okinawa Times owns stock in OTV. Often, executives rotate between them.  
Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting was founded by Ryukyu Shimpo. They literally live together. The office is inside the Ryukyu Shimpo Building.  
RBC. Ryukyu Shimpo has been a major shareholder historically.  

And btw, the current governor, Denny Tamaki, is from the local media. He was a media personality from RBC.  

Okinawa is literally a show run by local media.  
Governor, Newspaper, TV, all owned by the entity with a unified ideology.  
I call this the "Okinawa Cartel".  

### Okinawa is Little Russia; Politics resembles Putin's Russia

You may think I am joking. You may feel angry if you are Okinawan. 
It is one of the worst insults one could say today.  
You are right to be angry. But please, do not direct that anger at the messenger. 
Direct it at the system that made this comparison accurate.  
You are the victim of this entire structure.  

I did not use the term Russia lightly. The systemic similarities are terrifying.  

*   **Survival via Deception:** Both societies have a history where hiding the truth was necessary for survival for their citizens. (In Russia under the Soviets, "vranyo"; in Okinawa under Ming/Satsuma).  
*   **The Resource Curse:** Russia has Oil; Okinawa has "Strategic Location." Both elites live off the revenue generated by this resource (Oil money vs. Aid from the central) rather than developing a real economy.  
*   **The Rentier State:** Because the money comes from the ground (or the bases), the government doesn't need to listen to the people to survive.  
*   **Information Autocracy:** A single ideology creates a total monopoly on media and politics.  
*   **Weaponized Victimhood:** Both genuinely suffered in WW2, but the state weaponizes that trauma to shut down debate. "We are the eternal victims; therefore, we are always right."
*   **External Enemy Doctrine:** All internal failures are blamed on an outside force (The West/NATO for Russia; Tokyo/USA for Okinawa).  
*   **Pseudo-History:** Both education systems teach a "cleaned" version of history. They hide their own aggressive or complex origins to maintain the "Pure Victim" narrative.  
*   **The "Traitor" Label:** In both societies, anyone who questions the official narrative is not just "wrong," they are branded a "foreign agent" or "traitor to the people."
*   **Dependence on Conflict:** Peace is bad for business and politics. If the conflict ends, the identity (and the money) evaporates.  
*   **Promise future but not bring it:** The ruling narrative claims that rulers are the savior of the people, but improving citizens' lives rarely happens without political necessity.  

I'll say it again: Culturally, structurally, politically, and psychologically, Okinawa politics is functioning like Russia.  

Now the governor, who is from local media, sends tax money to these local media via ads.  
They are so successful that they capture the prefecture.  
People of Okinawa pay tax for the "infinite conflict machine" that keeps them suffering and poor.  

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  
* Cut the aid that is part of the reason for the media and poor Okinawa.  
* Give Okinawans a real history education. They only get the national standard one, and nobody in Okinawa knows the real history of Okinawa. That's * why the media can say "we are the only truth and we are all saints". The history is not that long; 10 hours would suffice to cover the entirety in detail.  
* Illegalize the extreme concentration of power, which Okinawa is currently doing. You don't want to have more Russia; one is already too much.  
* Find a way to curve the media monopoly. Provide diverse information sources for locals.  
* End the conflict(Okinawa vs. Japan/US). Without it, they will lose power slowly.  
* Petition the Japan Fair Trade Commission (公正取引委員会) to investigate the connection between the Newspapers, the TV Stations, and politicians in Okinawa.
