# 2: "This is the cost of National Security. We have to pay it."

If this is about National Security, we shouldn't pay 300 Billion Yen to Okinawa.  

### We are losing the war before it even begins. 

Modern war is decided by how many missiles you stockpile.  

With 300 Billion Yen, you can buy **1,000 Tomahawk long-range missiles**. That amount can decide a war outcome. And we have been wasting it for over 50 years. Every year.  
Or you can even build missile factories. We could've helped Ukraine indirectly. They need the help desperately; their innocent citizens are dying because they lack missiles. And we are wasting 1,000 long-range missiles in front of them. Every year.  

From a military economic perspective, Okinawa is one of the absurd "military spending" in history. 
It's **Military Suicide**.  

We are losing the war before it even begins.  
We are scraping the bottom of the barrel to find money for defense, our taxes are rising, while burning 300 Billion Yen to build "deficit infrastructure" in Okinawa.  
And while we are wasting our tax money, China has stockpiled 3,000+ ballistic/cruise missiles. Which roughly 2000 can hit Tokyo. 
Japan only has roughly 1500 interceptors. 
In this gap, even in the best scenario, 1,000 to 1,200 can hit Tokyo. We can't intercept them mathematically.  
The gap in total military prowess is widening. And when this ratio becomes large enough, China will have confidence to act.  

### National Security Negligence by Tokyo's politicians

And if this is truly about National Security, why is it even up for debate?
If the bases are essential for Japan's survival, allowing them to be blocked by local politics is a **crime against the nation.**

I am not talking about a crime by the Okinawan people. They are acting within their rights.  
I am talking about the **Crime of the Politicians in Tokyo.**

National Security is the one thing that cannot be negotiated. It is the sacred duty of the State.  
Yet, our politicians have created a legal system where a single local mayor can hold the entire nation's safety hostage.  
They have effectively legalized the disruption of our National Defense.  

You do not ask for "permission" to put out a fire. You do not negotiate whether to lock the front door.  
To treat National Survival as a "local petition" is not Democracy.  
It is a **dereliction of Sovereign Duty.**

The current situation doesn't make sense if the money is about National Security or "rent".  
As we learned in "1", this is the money to keep Okinawa weak and dependent.  

Let me repeat the current situation because it's so absurd:
**This 300 Billion Yen is not buying Security. It is buying Vulnerability.**

### Poverty is a hole in our armor: Vulnerable to Chinese influence
A poor, resentful population that relies on Chinese tourists or Chinese imports/exports is a population that can be manipulated by China.  
China doesn't need to invade with tanks; they just need to turn off the switch, and the economy will collapse.  
China can even blackmail to change sides. That is happening in other Pacific islands like Palau. Where the US is doing the "dependency" strategy.  

By keeping Okinawa weak and dependent, and resentful, Tokyo is practically **gift-wrapping** the island for influence operations.  

**True National Security is not a weak dependency.**
**True National Security is rich citizens and missiles.**
A rich, industrial, self-sufficient Okinawa that doesn't need Tokyo's money—and doesn't need Beijing's tourists—is the ultimate defense.  

We are spending 300 Billion Yen a year to maintain a weak point in our armor.  
That isn't "Defense Spending." That is **Defense Undermining.**

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  

* Because the aid has a negative effect on national security.  
* Tokyo's politicians are neglecting their duty by enabling the local politicians to disrupt national security.  
* It's creating a vulnerability while consuming precious resources.  
* Let's get more missiles so China will think that it'll be costly to attack us.
