# 8: "If we help, they'll like us."

Sadly, **this is not true.**
 
People might like help, but might dislike the person who sends the help.  
When this plays out at a national level, the recipient often becomes the donor's most passionate hater.  
Understanding this is important to figure out Okinawa.  

I touched on this in the introduction, about the weird tendency that a US aid recipient sometimes becomes the most passionate US hater.  
And I explain here why it happens where nationalism is strong.  
Okinawa has strong nationalism. Where the media has a dominant presence, it gets a strong identity. Because it's good for the media business.  

### Nationalism prefers the victimhood
The fundamental axiom of Nationalism is: "We are capable. We are independent. We are the main characters of our own story."
Nationalism will be crushed if external help is the main driver of success.  
If Nation A got external help, in pure identity logic, they have only two choices to maintain their self-esteem.  
1. Ignoring the goodness of the help
2. Offsetting the goodness of the help with badness from the sender

Where nationalism is strong(relying on Nationalism), external help actually makes recipients hate the sender.  
Because they have to find the badness of the sender.  
The offset mechanism often works with manufacturing the story.  
I call this "Nationalism Offset".  

### Example of Nationalism Offset: Soviet pay blood, US pay trucks.  

The US provided $11 billion (in 1940s dollars) of trucks, food, and fuel via Lend-Lease. Without it, the Red Army might have starved or lacked mobility. 
Stalin and subsequent Soviet historians used the Nationalism Offset.  
The narrative is this: "The US gave money and trucks, but we gave *blood*. We lost 27 million people. Therefore, the American aid was actually a cheap way for them to avoid fighting. They *owe us* for saving the world."
By framing the aid as a "cynical payment" to avoid casualties, the USSR turned a gift into a debt. The "goodness" of the trucks was offset by the "badness" of the US arriving late to the Western Front.  

This is one example of the Nationalism Offset. 
You can see that aid actually makes the Soviets hate the US. The US became a puppet master with decadent money, manipulated Soviet citizens into a meat grinder.  
You can see this phenomenon around the world. Those who send aid get hated by the recipient.  

Why and how does this happen? 
Let's start with a simple and relatable example.  

### Student's Capability Equation: I didn't study for the exam

Students love to say, "I didn't study for the exam". I have to admit I was one of them.  
Let's analyze that because it helps to understand any nation or group, including Okinawa.  

Score = Student's Effort + Student's Natural Intelligence + Environmental Factors
It makes sense, right?
Let's rearrange the order to center the intelligence.  

* **Student's Natural Intelligence = Score - Student's Effort - Environmental Factors**

The student wants to make himself look smart. But how?
Taking a high score? No, it will need real effort; the student is lazy. Or he might be finished exam already, the score is decided.  

When the student says, "I didn't study for the exam." He is making the right-hand side bigger by claiming "Student's Effort" was zero.  
That makes his "Natural intelligence" high. That's why students love to say it.  
It will be more effective if the student says, "I haven't slept, so I'm not in good condition". Which again the right-hand side becomes bigger by claiming "Environmental Factor" was minus. 

### Introducing the CAE equation: how the Percieved Capability Model works

"We are capable" is the first mantra of nationalism. Yes, it's the most important thing for them.  
Make the student equation a national level. Combine the effort and the natural intelligence into "Capability", that is the root of nationalism.  
* **Percieved Capability = Percieved Achievement - Percieved Factors**

$$
C_p = A_p - E_p
$$

To short C = A - E
* Perceived National Capability(C) means the total perceived capability of a nation. This is the pride of nationalism. This is also a combined variable of National Natural Ability and National Effort.  
* Perceived National Achievement(A) means the perceived greatness of national achievement. This is relatively hard to move, unless they reframe the achievement.  
* Perceived Environmental Factor(E) means perceived factors that help an achievement, but not from the nationals. This includes Foreign Aid and Natural resources or anything useful, but not the people. This often acts as the parameter when actors manipulate the national esteem.  

This simple "Perceived National Capability" model helps you understand any nationalism in our world.  

This explains why Russians hate the US, why the Americans love "agency" and ignore the natural resource advantage they have.  
Okinawa is not an exception. Using this equation, we can explain why Okinawans hate Tokyo/the US. And wasting the aid can be optimal for their identity.  

To raise Nationalism, which is closely related to National Capability (C), you can work on 3 variables.  
1. Make C High: e.g., Reframing national capability(trait) better than the current perceived one.  
2. Make A High: e.g., Archiving more. Reframing past achievements higher.  
3. Make E Low: e.g., Erasing good from outside. Reframing the good from outside as bad, normal, or small. Exaggerating the bad from outside.  

### Russian invasion of Ukraine: offset the humiliation by introducing NATO

Let's see how the equation helps us to understand the situation.  
You are Putin (I'm sorry to say that), and you want to bolster nationalism because that keeps you in power.  
**Percieved National Capability = Percieved National Achievement - Percieved Environmental Factors**
According to the equation, you can boost nationalism(= perceived capability) by National Achievement. You decided to invade Ukraine. Not only that, you want to "capture Kyiv in 3 days" because it makes the National Achievement more impressive.  
You start it. And it seems things are not going as you planned. You actually accidentally proved Russia is less capable by achieving "Stalemate with a much weaker country". National Achievement is declining rapidly, and so is National Capability.  

What do you do?
You still have the Environmental Factors variable.  
To maintain the narrative that Russia is capable(keep nationalism high to stay in power), you have to make the case that the Environmental Factor is massively negative, because the failure was so catastrophic.  
So, you introduce the narrative "We are fighting against the entire NATO."
NATO is the biggest military. Being attacked by NATO is the worst military condition you can find on earth. By making Environmental Factors negative, you try to save the perceived Russia Capability as positive as before the failure.  

"We are fighting against the entire NATO" is the official narrative and is widely believed among Russians. 
At least inside Russia, you successfully saved the perceived capability of Russia, which secures your power.  

### Japan's Lost 30 Years: offset the US help
Did Japanese people suddenly stop working hard in 1991?

Btw, losing 30 years doesn't exist in reality. Because of inflation, and Real GDP vs. the Nominal GDP.  
**It's a fantasy.** 
The question is, why does the story persist?

"Lost 30 years" (1991-present) is the shadow of the "economic miracle" (1950–1990).  
Because the "miracle" exists, "lost" exists.  
So, why did Japan perform a miracle? 
Because Japanese workers work harder than any other nation, right?

**Sadly, no.**
And that's why we created the "lost" story to make ourselves comfortable.  

The most important factor of the miracle is 
1. Japan was selling its product to the US, the wealthiest market on earth. 
Japan was ranked the #2 exporter to the US in that period, next to #1 Canada. 
2. Fixed exchange rate with US dollar (360 Yen/$) under Bretton Woods system (1944-1971)

Because Yen was cheap, and the US is the wealthiest market, the trading profitability was so high.  
That's the reason for the miracle. 
If Yen becomes stronger, that means profitability decline on the US trade.  
1971 (Nixon Shock): The US killed the fixed rate
1985 (Plaza Accord): The Yen went from ~240 to ~120 rapidly.  
The miracle only lasted 5 years after 120 Yen/$; 
The miracle was mostly the result of the US policy.  

And also, this is how Korea, Taiwan, and China got wealthy, all of them exporting massively to the US during their "miracle".  

But, no Japanese wanted to admit it; The miracle must be the result of our effort.  
**National Capability = National Achievement - Environmental Factors**
See, if American policy (+E) is the driver, the miracle will be taken away from our capability.  
So we erased "Environmental Factor" from our story, so Japan can be proud #2 (at that time) economic power.  
In this way, we can delude ourselves that our capability (C) is high; the miracle is ours.  

It's a good thing that we didn't use the outsider helper as the villain to save face. 
We had a choice to frame America as a bad guy and "offset" the help. That's what the Soviets did, and China is now doing.  

That's why we have the story "Lost 30 years". 
BTW, Japan’s productivity growth per worker from 1990–2010 was actually higher than the US and Europe.  

### The hardworking people in Oil countries: Offset the luck

We saw Japan created the "hardworking" myth to save its sanity.  
You can see this phenomenon in many nations that have experienced lucky economic growth.  

Why do Americans have "agency" worship? American Dream? Hard Working?
Because they got lucky on natural resources and geography. They are the luckiest country on earth.  
They had been the sole important oil producer(+E) for the most important period in history, and that's the reason for its economic might. But you guessed it, they can't admit it.  
They had the largest 'E' advantage on earth. But you can't feel proud of luck. So what do you do?
They erased E from their story. Like we, Japan, erased American help (-E) from our "miracle" (A).  
It has to be the people who did the job. That's why Americans believe "hardworking" is a virtue.  
"Protestant Work Ethic"(+C) is another offset, but not the real cause. Because other Protestants don't have fanatic agency worship, the difference is luck(oil).  

The USSR (now Russia) had this too. They believe they are super resilient people, and that's the reason for their success. 
Once, they became the #2 economy in the world.  
They believed it was because of Communism and the Russian people. But the fact is the same with the US. Natural resources.	

Here is a short timeline of the largest oil producer in history.  
1. USA (1859 – 1898)
2. Russia (1898 – 1901)
3. USA (1902 – 1973)
4. Russia (back then USSR)(1974 – 1991)
5. Saudi Arabia (1992 – 2013)
6. USA (2014 – Present)

Americans love to call Saudi Arabia "Oil country".  
Let's prove that. Here is the total years as the #1.  
1. United States: ~120 Years: 1859–1898, 1902–1973, 2014–Present.  
2. Russia (Empire/USSR/Federation): ~30 Years: 1898–1901, 1974–1991, and roughly 2006–2013
3. Saudi Arabia: ~15 Years: 1992–2005 (and a few scattered months/years in between).  

Wait, actually, the US is the undisputed Oil country on earth. 
Importantly, the US was almost always the biggest oil producer in the earliest era, over 100 years (1859 - 1973). 

As Thomas Piketty ("Capital in the Twenty-First Century") showed, having wealth has a bigger impact on growth than work itself.  
That also means early wealth is better than later wealth. And the US had the earliest oil wealth.  

The US doesn't want to say that they have succeeded because of oil or luck (+E). 
That's why they erased the E, and introduced the "hard-working" (C) myth to offset the erase.  

I know what you think. "Saudi Arabia mustn't think they are hard-working."
Right?
You will be surprised.  

Saudis, particularly the younger generation, increasingly view themselves as entrepreneurial and hard-working.  
97% of young Saudis link their hard work directly to the success of the national Vision 2030 project.  

Their "Oil King" title is relatively modern and short (15 Years: 1992–2005); they had no time to rewrite their story for an entire population.  
So they only succeeded with the younger generation, who are easy to educate.  
The old generation thinks Oil is a gift from god, the reward of their faith. The mechanic is the same. Their faith (C) made the oil (A), not the luck (+E).  

I bet after 50 years, they call themselves "the hardest working people on earth."
And seems I'm winning the bet. Saudi Arabia is currently promoting "Vision 2030", this project effectively tries to force-feed the "Hard Work/Innovation" myth to its population.  

### Okinawa and Tokyo's aid: wasted aid only created hate

When aid(+E) came, locals had to create the offset stories(-E) to keep C high.  
This is one of the reasons so many exaggerated, hateful stories come from Okinawa. 
It's an emotional coping mechanism of Nationalism. 

Another way to cope with it is to waste it. Because if the aid didn't create an effect, it's the same as no aid. 
This is erase external aid(+E) but not erase offset stories(-E).  
Okinawa's economy is not improving. It's the poorest. 
Only the offset story(-E) remains there. That's why C can remain high, and hateful victimhood is strong.  

### Okinawa Nationalism's relatively small Achievement: It needs victimhood to just exist

Okinawa has the strongest local cultural identity among Japanese prefectures. 
And it loves to tell a story, placing itself among Japan and China as peers. (e.g., mainland Japan vs. Okinawa, Ming as a trade partner)

This is a very difficult battle, even culturally(which is their strongest point), because the benchmarks are too big, physically, culturally, and historically.  
Both China and Japan are cultural superpowers. Japanese culture is one of the most cherished in the modern world. China is a civilization; its historical depth is undefeatable by anyone.  

Because Okinawa is choosing to act as a peer of these cultural superpowers, it has always had a massive deficit in its Achievements. This creates the pressure that they have to create the offset story to introduce a negative Environmental Factor.  
Okinawa just achieved so little compared to the two.  
Because local media tried to create nationalism in this relatively negative Achievement, the only way to create National Capability is to create the offset stories(-E).  
Okinawa Nationalism needs victimhood just to exist. Their current main supplier is the bases.  
When the bases(or the problems) are gone, and if they can't find another victimhood deposit, Nationalism in Okinawa will decline.  

Yes, as long as they choose to place themselves as "peer" of China or Japan, they have to tell a story of victimhood to keep themselves sane.

(aid/tax is normalized by Okinawa)  
(Source: dev aid/tax is data form e-Stat, average of 1989-2017 , calculated by (国庫支出金:普通建設事業費支出金 + 国庫支出金:その他)/地方税)
(Source: Local newspaper share is from 新聞広告を介した情報流通の地域的差異性 福井一喜 2013. I counted the pixels. the paper is based on 2006～2007年（日本 ABC 協会第24回公査レポート))

There could be many factors here. Business Logic of national newspapers are likely the most strongest one.
CAE can also provide a explnation.
Getting aid(+E) hurts C, so if they want to feel better about themselves. manipulation on C and E can be done easily by media.

Sometime Okinawa newspaper is described as a tool of aid acquisition. But not only that, it can be a mechanism to stay sane in a situation where local pride is undermined. They need the narrative to keep them sane. If we want to address the media duopoly there, we need to give them replacement of the pride source.

Economic power prefecture doesn't need to maintain its pride. (C = A - E). They already have big enough A and have little aid from outside. Their identities are psychologically comfortable without creating a story.
And still they can have an additional story, like Aichi. They do not require to have local story to be comfortable. That's why the high dependency prefectures almost always have a high local newspaper share.

### Psychological need of Okinawa people

They read the local papers not for information, but for validation. They need a daily confirmation that they are the protagonists of a tragedy, not the recipients of a subsidy.

The 99.4% share is the measure of how desperate that psychological need is.

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  
* The aid makes Okinawa hate Tokyo.  
* The aid creates the environment in which nationalism thrives, and it requires hating outsiders just to exist because Okinawa is surrounded by real cultural superpowers, and nationalism demands acting like a peer of them.
