# 4: "Politicians of Naha want to improve the economy of Okinawa."

Because tax revenue from the Okinawa economy is so tiny compared to money from Tokyo, they have zero, even negative, incentive to develop the local economy.  
That's why they are obsessed with outsiders(where money comes from), but rarely provide real improvements for the people of Okinawa.  

You might be wondering: *"Why are they so incompetent?"*
You ask: *"Why, after 50 years and 14.8 Trillion Yen, have they failed to build a strong industry?"*
You assume they are trying to succeed but failing.  

No. **They are succeeding at "Failing."**

"Wasting the aid money".  
You call it failure, politicians in Naha call it success.  

Let's start with data.

### Okinawa is the "Permanent Disaster" Zone (Financially)
*   **Fukushima 2nd (95%) & Kumamoto 3rd (41%):** These prefectures are high on the list because of **major disasters**.  
    *   Fukushima: Ongoing recovery from the 2011 Earthquake/Tsunami/Nuclear disaster.  
    *   Kumamoto: This data is for FY2017. Kumamoto was hit by a massive earthquake in **2016**. They were in peak reconstruction mode.  
*   **Okinawa (108%):** There was no massive natural disaster in Okinawa in 2017. **This is their "normal."**
    *   Okinawa is receiving *more* aid relative to tax than a prefecture recovering from a nuclear meltdown.  

*   **National Average:** **12%**.  
**Okinawa (108% ) is 9x the National Average.**

**Okinawa operates under a completely different set of rules** than the rest of Japan.  

And remember, this doesn't even include the Local Allocation Tax for salaries/operations, Social Security, or military rent. This is just the "Building & Development" money.  

### aid/tax ratio (1989-2017): Okinawa 157.2%, Nationwide avg 24.9%.

This is the all data available in e-Stat I could find.
Seems like Okinawa anomaly is accelarating.

### Naha politician's optimal financial strategy: Keep Okinawa poor for Money Begging 
What data tells you is this.  

* If Tokyo gets the double Development Aid relative to the current amount received from Nagata-cho.  
It would gain only 3% of the tax revenue. "It's not worth the time; let's develop local industry."

* If Naha gets the double  Development Aid relative to the current amount received from Nagata-cho.  
It would gain 108% of the tax revenue. "This is the oil field!. **Let's forget the local economy, keep it poor to get more aid.**"

It's the optimal choice for Naha politicians to neglect, or even structurally undermine, the local economy by misdirecting development targets.  

That table perfectly explains why Naha is so obsessed with outsiders and complains about everything outsider does.  
It's an optimal business strategy.  
Every time they complain, it can raise the possibility of higher aid as compensation.  
It's the best way to get money.  

### Not only that. Success is a Threat to the "Resistance": Politicians/media will lose their jobs. 
Imagine a politician in Okinawa who takes the 300 Billion Yen, invests it perfectly, and builds a booming Tech Industry.  
Okinawa becomes rich. The youth have high salaries. They buy their own houses. They stop caring about the "Tragedy of the Past" and start focusing on the "Luxury of the Future."
They realize that cooperation with Tokyo pays off.  

**What happens to that politician?**
He loses his job, which is secured by his anti-Tokyo stance.  
He loses the "Victim Narrative."
He loses the excuse to demand next year's 300 Billion Yen.  
The "Anti-Base" movement dies because people are too busy being rich.  

**In the current system, Economic Success is Political Suicide.**

### The Art of Wasting Money: Let's waste money that can develop local industry.

Why do they build useless concrete boxes? Why do they pave roads that don't need paving?
Why does the poorest prefecture have the longest fee-free bridge that has a massive maintenance cost? 

If they build something *useful* and *permanent* and *profitable* (like a high-tech industry or a university), the people will have to say: *"Tokyo helped us build this."*
The physical evidence of Tokyo's help remains. Gratitude grows. Nationalism dies. 

That's why they say the bridge is "The victory, we won it from Tokyo for our suffering."
They are reframing everything as looking good by "Because Tokyo did/do bad". 
Its balancing mechanism and good things that come from Tokyo actually can accelerate the "Tokyo is evil" narrative.  

There is an even better way.  
**But if they WASTE the money?**
Why did the 14.8 trillion yen aid not produce an effect?

1.  **The Money is consumed.** (The cronies get paid).  
2.  **The Evidence vanishes.** (There is no lasting asset to thank Tokyo for.)
3.  **The Poverty remains.** (So they can claim "We are still victims!").  
4.  **The Aid continues.** (Because we need more money, because still poor).  

**Inefficiency is not a bug. It is a feature.**

Think about it, what is good for Naha's politicians, they can get a good thing from making the Okinawa economy good?
If Okinawa becomes rich, ruling politicians in Naha will lose jobs.  
The local media is the true engine for their power, they too lose it's main reason to dominate the narrative.  

### The malfunctioning tourism industry is beneficial for politicians
(how malfunctioning is explained in: "9")  
This also explains the 50-year obsession with Tourism.  
Why Tourism?
And why don't they change the strategy despite a 50-year continuous failure?

Because they are "successfully" failing to create a real industry.  
It's the optimal choice for politicians and media.  
Successful industry = no aid.  
Successful Okinawa = no resentment = no media dominance.  

Tourism is their 'Trash Bin'. As shown in "9"(later chapter), it generates a fraction of the profit of military rent and has a disastrous ROI. It doesn't produce real wealth.  
It just burns aid money.  
And Naha politicians and local media are all happy.  

### Not only the Aid Curse and Nationalism: here is the Budget trap

In "1", we learned about the Aid Curse, that aid takes away the need for Okinawa to develop industry.  
In this chapter, I talked about the Naha politicians' incentives and why they want to waste the aid.  

And that's not all, we have more factors that hinder the Okinawa's development. 
We will explore the budget nature of the Okinawa aid.  

If you have ever worked inside a large organization, you know that "You have to spend the entire budget for this year".  
Why? Because if you don't spend it, next year you get less money. 
The distributor will think, "You didn't spend all the money last year, you didn't need that money, so I assume you don't need it this year, too."
You spent the budget even though you know it's an inefficient way to spend money. 

"Okinawa promotion budget" is the same.  
Okinawa has to spend every yen even if it will produce nothing.  
Actually, it's even better to create a negative result by building infrastructure that creates maintenance costs.  
Because if a real deficit is there, Okinawa can ask for more of the budget next year.  

Again, they are successfully "failing".  

### Unclear Okinawa role: Hokkaido has a clear role.  


The current special budget ignores the existence of Okinawa's agency and its economic challenges. 
We pour our tax to aid and send it to Okinawa, and think that automatically improves Okinawa.  
Like you put money into a vending machine to make it output the value.  

Hokkaido is often criticized for its large development aid.  
But as the table shows, the Aid/Tax ratio is not bad(26%). It's the 18th. It's massively efficient compared to Okinawa(108%).  
I checked FY2000 data, and it's 21th. Hokkaido is not dependent on the development aid, unlike Okinawa.  
It works because they have a clear way to convert the investment to value.  
Food production is a clear role that Hokkaido has. And Hokkaido has the second-largest plain in Japan. Economic potential is easy to see.  

Now look at Okinawa.  
They don't even know what industry is viable. 
They just believe tourism work (which doesn't. Refer to "9"). (And if we assume they really believe it rather than knowing it doesn't work, and let money burn, which is more likely from incentive analysis.)
They ended up just like Yubari, having no idea what to do with the aid. Creating Tourism infrastructures that generate a deficit.  
They just have no idea what to do with the money Tokyo sent.  

We need to give Okinawa the direction which pursue, and it needs Japan's collaboration.  
Okinawa alone can't implement the system that is required to be a viable economy.  

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  
* Okinawa is massively dependent on the aid, compared to other prefectures, which creates the reason to undermine local development.  
* The aid structure creates incentives to "fail" the development.  
* Wasting the aid is a good choice for Naha politicians. 
* If Okinawa becomes rich, Anti-base politicians/media lose jobs.  
* Give Okinawa a clear role like Hokkaido has.
