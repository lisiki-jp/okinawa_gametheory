# "The money you sent to Okinawa is for the Okinawa economy growth."
Every year, Tokyo hands Okinawa about 300 Billion Yen. They call it the "Okinawa Promotion Budget."
It's been over **50 years**.  
The total became roughly 14.8 Trillion Yen.  
The result? Okinawa is the poorest prefecture.  
Other prefectures don't get this special budget, and they are doing much better than Okinawa.  

Let's say you give a massive allowance to your child every day, and now the child is 50 years old and has no skills to earn money.  
The only thing he knows how to do is spend money.
Whose fault?
It's our fault. We have to stop this.  

### Aid Curse: good things sometime hurt local development
This phenomenon is well known among politicians and academics. It's called "Aid Curse". (a variant of the Resource Curse)
The observation became famous in "Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa" by Dambisa Moyo, published in 2009.  
This book fundamentally changed the public debate on development by arguing that systemic government-to-government aid has been a "curse" rather than a blessing for African countries.  
This Resource Curse(Aid Curse) doesn't have a single mechanism. It can be economic, political, or ideological reasons. The important point is that what is supposed to be "good"(e.g., aid or natural resources) can act as a negative factor for growth.  

I'll explain a simplified version that fits for Okinawa case. The mechanism here is that they don't develop industry because they don't have to. Because if aid provides money, why do they have to earn money? 
Or even it's better not to develop the economy. Because if they become rich, the aid ends.  
It's similar to why we Japanese are not excellent at English. Because our economy is big enough for us not to learn a foreign language. We don't have to.  
So, like we don't learn English, Okinawa doesn't develop industry.  

Have you ever heard of the Yubari city economic collapse?
That's "aid curse" in working. Tokyo sends massive aid to compensate for its energy policy shift that would hurt the coal city. And Yubari spends that money to build the massive tourism infrastructure. But aid was one-time, and the running cost of the tourism facility was on Yubari. And they went bankrupt.  
If Tokyo didn't send the aid, Yubari didn't crush that hard.  
This was city-level and short-term.  
Okinawa is a **prefecture-level** and has been **over 50 years**.  
Yes, Okinawa is Yubari, but worse, and bigger. They haven't gone bankrupt yet because Tokyo is sending our tax money to cover the deficit.  

The reason why does Tokyo do this?
Tokyo got the switch to ruin Okinawa.  
"If you don't obey, I can make you bankrupt by just stopping the aid."
The money is sent to make Okinawa poor and dependent. So Tokyo can control Okinawa. (e.g., bases)
"Okinawa Promotion" is a facade.  

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  

* The aid is hurting the Okinawa economy rather than developing it.  
* 14.8 Trillion Yen created the poorest prefecture in Japan.  
* Aid is taking away the reason to develop the local economy in Okinawa.  
* Okinawa is big Yubari. It built tourism infrastructure using aid from Tokyo and creating the deficit.
