# 7: The US wouldn't agree with it

**The Reality:** If the US loses Japan, it is "Game Over" for American hegemony.  
Their most important grand strategy is to control the Pacific, current mid-term goal is to contain China. This is impossible without Japan.  
We hold an extremely strong card—stronger than nuclear weapons: **Geopolitical Necessity.**
The US would happily accept some legal burdens if it keeps Japan friendly and the alliance stable.  

We can use this card to negotiate compromises, specifically regarding legal rights and sovereignty.  

### The US moved bases from mainland Japan because it was afraid of the Japanese majority.  

**The Evidence:**
In the past, the US moved the majority of its Marines to Okinawa. Why? Because Okinawa was under US military administration at the time, and they did not have to listen to the local people. But on the mainland, they were terrified of the Japanese majority's opinion.  

It is a declassified historical fact that the CIA secretly funded prominent Japanese politicians in the 1950s and 60s. Their goal was to keep anti-base socialists out of power and ensure the security treaty survived. **The US has always been terrified of Japanese public opinion turning against them.**

The only reason politicians don't negotiate for better terms today is simply that we, the Japanese majority, do not demand it.  
As long as the majority stays silent, politicians have no incentive to rock the boat.  

**The Okinawa people alone can't solve this.** Democracy is a numbers game. Okinawa represents only 1.2% of the population. The US and the Japanese government can ignore a minority.  
**They cannot ignore the majority.**

We must solve this because we are the only ones who have the power to solve it. It is not an "Okinawa problem"; it is a "Japanese Sovereignty problem."

### Germans get a fairer deal. Why not the Japanese?

Both nations lost the war. Both are key US allies. Yet, the inequality is staggering:
*   **Germany:** US bases must follow German law, and German police have access.  
*   **Japan:** US bases are extraterritorial, and Japanese laws generally do not apply.  

This is despite the fact that the German military is currently undersized and under-equipped, while Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are highly capable, technologically advanced, and occupy the most critical strategic position against China.  

**We are paying more (financially and strategically) but getting less (rights).**

If the US refuses to grant us the same rights it granted Germany, we are forced to ask: **Is this because we are Asian?**
The US prides itself on equality. They cannot afford to be seen as enforcing a racially biased double standard in the 21st century. If we, the Japanese majority, raise our voices and demand "The German Standard," the US will have no choice but to agree. To do otherwise would destroy their reputation and alienate their most important ally.  

Internal stability is what politicians hate to lose most. If the Japanese public frames this as a matter of "National Dignity" and "Racial Equality," the US will yield.  

Given this leverage, demanding a partnership of equals like the **NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)** is a realistic and highly professional negotiation goal.  

Here is a list of specific negotiation points Japan should prioritize to make the alliance fairer and more "NATO-like."

### 1. Legal System: The "German Model" (NATO-like)
The current U.S.-Japan SOFA is essentially a copy of the old 1950s administrative agreement. Japan should negotiate to adopt the **German Supplementary Agreement** (the specific NATO SOFA version used in Germany), which grants the host nation far more sovereignty.  

*   **Application of Domestic Law (Article 53 of German Supp. Agreement):**
    *   *Current Japan Status:* U.S. bases are effectively extraterritorial. Japanese laws (building codes, environmental regulations, labor laws) generally do not apply inside the fences.  
    *   *Negotiation Point:* Adopt the German rule where **Japanese domestic law applies inside U.S. bases** unless strictly incompatible with military duty. This would mean U.S. buildings must meet Japanese earthquake/fire standards and, crucially, Japanese environmental laws would be binding, not voluntary.  
*   **Police Authority & Access:**
    *   *Current Japan Status:* Japanese police cannot enter U.S. bases without explicit consent, even to chase a fleeing criminal or investigate a fire.  
    *   *Negotiation Point:* Grant Japanese police the authority to enter bases to restore public safety or investigate crimes (similar to how German police have authority within U.S. housing areas in Germany when public order is at risk).  
*   **Custody of Suspects:**
    *   *Current Japan Status:* The U.S. keeps custody of accused soldiers until they are *indicted* (charged) by Japanese prosecutors. This often hampers investigations.  
    *   *Negotiation Point:* Align with the NATO/South Korea standard where the host nation can take custody *before* indictment for serious crimes.  

### 2. Airspace: Return the "Yokota Rapcon"
Control over the airspace of a nation's capital by a foreign military is a global anomaly.  
*   *Current Status:* The U.S. Air Force at Yokota Air Base controls a massive block of airspace over Tokyo and surrounding prefectures (the "Yokota Rapcon"). Commercial flights from Haneda often have to fly inefficient low routes or make wide detours to avoid it, burning extra fuel and increasing costs.  
*   *Negotiation Point:* **Complete return of air traffic control to Japan.** The U.S. military would then file flight plans and coordinate with Japanese controllers, just as airlines do. This is how it works in Germany and the UK; the Luftwaffe and RAF control their own sovereign airspace, and the USAF coordinates with them.  

### 3. Environmental Sovereignty (High Priority)
This is currently one of the most unfair aspects of the alliance compared to NATO.  
*   *Current Status:* Under Article IV of the current SOFA, the U.S. has **no obligation** to restore land to its original condition or clean up pollution (e.g., PFAS/forever chemicals) when it return land to Japan. Japan pays for the cleanup (taxpayer money).  
*   *Negotiation Point:* **"Polluter Pays" Principle.** Revise Article IV to mandate that the U.S. is responsible for environmental remediation. Japan should also demand the **right to conduct on-site environmental inspections** (soil/water testing) inside operational bases, a right that German authorities possess but Japanese authorities do not.  

### 4. Accident Investigation Rights
*   *Current Status:* When a U.S. military aircraft crashes in Japan (even outside a base, like in a civilian university or field), the U.S. military creates an "inner cordon" and physically blocks Japanese police and investigators from the site. Japan has no legal right to seize the wreckage or investigate the cause.  
*   *Negotiation Point:* Establish a **Joint Investigation Right** where Japanese police and transport safety officials have guaranteed access to the "inner cordon" of off-base accidents. The current "guidelines" are vague; this needs to be a treaty right.  

### 5. Financial Fairness (Burden Sharing)
Japan pays the highest "Host Nation Support" (Omoiyari Yosan) in the world.  
*   *Current Status:* Japan pays for utility bills, local staff salaries, and even training relocation costs for U.S. troops. Historically, Japan has covered ~75% of the stationing costs.  
*   *Comparison:* Germany covers only about 30% (mostly "in-kind" contributions like land and tax waivers). South Korea pays around 40%.  
*   *Negotiation Point:* **Reduce the "Sympathy Budget."** Japan should argue that since it is drastically increasing its *own* defense spending (doubling to 2% of GDP) to help the U.S. strategy (countering China), it should stop paying for the U.S. military's electricity and entertainment bills. That money should be redirected to the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to strengthen the alliance's actual hardware.  

### Summary of Negotiation Strategy
Japan's message should not be "Anti-American," but rather **"Pro-Alliance Modernization."**
> *"We want a sustainable alliance for the next 50 years. To do that, we must update our 1960s 'occupation-style' contract to a modern 'partner-style' contract, just like the U.S. has with the UK and Germany."*

### Conclusion: The US has to accept the Japanese majority's demands.  
* They will not hear the voice of the 1.2% in Okinawa, but they cannot ignore the voice of the 99% on the mainland.  
* The entire Japanese population shares the burden of lost sovereignty (airspace, legal rights).  
* We have the strongest negotiation card in history. It is time to play it.
