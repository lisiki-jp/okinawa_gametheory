# 9: Okinawa tourism is the future

If a core business strategy hasn't turned a profit in 50 years, yet you refuse to change course and demand more money to double down... that is not a 'Plan.' It is a Religion.  

The Okinawa tourism reality was darker than I initially thought, and we must address this. 
Because institutional inertia is too strong on this. 

We must stop spending money on tourism.  

Quick summary
* Military rent alone is generating a profit 6 times higher than tourism. The combined external aid is at least 51 times bigger than the tourism profit(and "combined" does not include every external aid, since I was using Okinawa prefecture's terminology).  
* Return on Investment (ROI) is disastrous. Okinawa tourism industry's estimated operational profit is tiny ~68.2 Billion Yen(2024), despite substantial investment.  
* The Okinawa tourism can't even defeat Fukuoka in inbound. Fukuoka is not even trying to be a "Tourism Kingdom".  
* These are the result of the attempts to make tourism the best industry in Okinawa for over 50 years, with massive development aid totaling 14兆8,000億円. 
* The math simply doesn't work; It creates low-wage workers. Okinawa has a population that is too large to rely on tourists. 
* Beach is the sales point. And that's bad, it's commodity. Only Korean and Taiwanease are the potential main customers.  
* And even that beach is weak. Okinawa has winter. Competitors not.  
* Luxury tourism is a trap that Okinawa doesn't want to pursue. It will make locals servants of outsider riches.  
* The Okinawa government likely knows tourism will not work.  
* Okinawa government's official plan for tourism, "第６次沖縄県観光振興基本計画", can be seen as a confession of giving up.  

### The Hard Truth: Why Tourism is a Dead End

Okinawa has been trying the 'Tourism Strategy' since the Ocean Expo in 1975.  
That is 50 Years.  
If a core business strategy hasn't turned a profit in 50 years, yet you refuse to change course and demand more money to double down... that is not a 'Plan.' It is a Religion.  
We gave Tourism half a century. The result is the lowest wages in Japan.  
It is time to admit: The tourism failed.  

Tourism ROI has been negative. It's not just suboptimal, it's negative.  
They build roads, bridges, and facilities for the name under Tourism.  
And no profit. Only the deficit remains.  
We can't do this anymore. Japan is a falling economic power. We have to be efficient.  

Politicians love to scream "Tourism Nation!"
But let’s look at the cold, hard reality of Okinawa’s tourism "weapon."

### **The only weapon Okinawa Tourism has is "The Beach."**: it can't attract wealthy Europeans(Americans)

And that is the problem.  
In the global market, a beach is a **Commodity.** It is not unique.  
There are beautiful beaches in Thailand, in Bali, in Hawaii, and in the Mediterranean. Sand and sea are everywhere on Earth.  
And Okinawa has winter, Bali, Hawaii, and so many competitors don't. 

Compare this to Kyoto.  
Kyoto has 1,000 years of history. That is a **Monopoly.** You cannot find another Kiyomizu Temple in the world. People travel from New York and Paris to see it.  
Okinawa does not have that monopoly.  
Also, season. Kyoto can operate 365 days. Okinawa beaches can operate about 140 – 150 Days a year, because of winter and weather.  

### Beach comparison: Okinawa, Bali, and Hawaii: The wall too high to climb.

| Feature | **Okinawa (Japan)** | **Bali (Indonesia)** | **Honolulu(Hawaii)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open Season** | **Apr – Oct** (7 months) | **Year-round** (Best: May–Oct) | **Year-round** |
| **Annual Sunshine**| **~1,700 hours** (Cloudy often) | **~2,700 hours** | **~3,000+ hours** (Very Sunny) |
| **Typhoons** | **High Risk** (Aug – Sept) | Low Risk (Cyclones rare) | Low Risk (Hurricanes rare) |
| **Water Temp** | 22°C (Spring) – 30°C (Summer) | 27°C – 29°C (Consistent) | 24°C – 27°C (Consistent) |

We just can't fight. 
We can't change the weather.  

Okinawa has the clearest sea among the three. So it's great for diving.  
The problem is that most people do not dive; it requires a license. 

### **Who comes to Okinawa?**: Only from pyshicaly close countries without beaches. 

Mainly tourists from Taiwan and Korea, they make up roughly 90% of inbound tourists.  
Why? Not because it’s the "Best Beach in the World."
But because it is the **"Nearest, Cheapest Beach."**
They come because it is close.  
You might think China is the solution. But China has its own beautiful beaches, unlike Koreans and Taiwanese. That's why they don't come to Okinawa.  

There is no room for growth here.  
You cannot attract wealthy Europeans or Americans to fly 20 hours just for a beach they can find in Florida or Spain.  
We are trapped in a "Regional Budget Tourism" market.  

### **The math simply doesn't work**: Too many people to feed. Taiwanese and Koreans can't do this.

Okinawa has a population of **1.46 Million.**
You cannot feed 1.46 million people by selling shaved ice to budget tourists from Taiwan.  
Tourism works for a small island of 50,000 people. It creates poverty for a prefecture of 1.5 million.  
We need something scalable. We need something global. We need something Okinawa can sell to the entire world.  

### Tourism is the reason for the poverty: Creating low-wage workers
Financial Capability Index (財政力指数). Okinawa is consistently ranked #47 (Dead last) or close to it.  
Okinawa has the lowest minimum wage in Japan (currently ~896-950 JPY range, depending on recent hikes, always fighting for last place).  
Tourism creates jobs that pay so little that the workers pay almost no Residence Tax (住民税) or Income Tax (所得税).  
It can't pay the massive development cost.  
Poverty is the result of 50 years of focus on tourism.  

The Okinawa tourism industry is a parasite.  
It creates jobs, yes. But they are the lowest-paying jobs in Japan.  
These wages are so low that the workers cannot pay enough tax to cover the cost of their own existence (roads, police, schools).  

Here is how 'Tourism Kingdom' works:
1. Tourism companies pay minimum wage (the lowest in Japan).  
2. Workers pay almost zero income tax because they are poor.  
3. The Government must use tax money from Tokyo (Aid) to maintain the infrastructure these tourists use.  

We are not running an industry. We are running a Deficit Machine.  
Not only people, but the tourism infrastructure creates the deficit. 
The more tourists we accept, the poorer the prefecture becomes because every new low-wage job increases the social burden without increasing the tax revenue.  

### The profit estimation: ROI disaster (Estimated tourism profit is 68.2 Billion Yen)
> 沖縄県の観光収入はコロナ禍からV字回復し、2024年度速報値で過去最高額の9835億円を記録

Let's estimate the profit.  
Tourism revenue is difficult to estimate because "tourism" involves various industries with different profit structures (hotels, transport, retail, dining).  
However, based on Japanese service industry standards and current economic conditions in Okinawa, we can estimate the aggregate operating profit to be roughly **between 50 billion and 80 billion yen (approx. 5% - 8% of revenue).**

Tourism revenue is not a monolith. We need to break down where that 983.5 billion yen goes and apply average profit margins for those specific industries.  

**A. Accommodation (Hotels/Ryokans) ~35% of spending**
*   **Revenue Share:** approx. 344 billion yen.  
*   **Margin:** The hotel industry typically operates on thin margins (5%), but 2024 saw significant price hikes (ADR - Average Daily Rate increased).  
*   **Est. Margin:** 10% (High performance due to price increases).  
*   **Profit:** ~34.4 billion yen.  

**B. Shopping (Souvenirs/Retail) ~25% of spending**
*   **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen.  
*   **Margin:** Retail operating margins in Japan are generally low.  
*   **Est. Margin:** 4%.  
*   **Profit:** ~9.8 billion yen.  

**C. Food & Beverage ~25% of spending**
*   **Revenue Share:** approx. 246 billion yen.  
*   **Margin:** Restaurants face high ingredient costs and labor shortages.  
*   **Est. Margin:** 5% (Standard for healthy dining businesses).  
*   **Profit:** ~12.3 billion yen.  

**D. Transportation (Local) & Activities ~15% of spending**
*   **Revenue Share:** approx. 147 billion yen.  
*   **Margin:** Rental cars have high margins currently due to shortages/high prices, but buses/taxis operate on very slim margins.  
*   **Est. Margin:** 8%.  
*   **Profit:** ~11.7 billion yen.  

Summing up the estimated profits:

*   Accommodation: 34.4
*   Shopping: 9.8
*   Food/Bev: 12.3
*   Transport/Activity: 11.7
*   **Total Estimated Operating Profit: ~68.2 Billion Yen**

This falls squarely in the **50–80 billion yen** range. So, likely not far from the truth.  

The tragedy is that even this estimated 68 billion yen profit doesn't stay here. The major hotels are owned by Tokyo or Foreign capital. We keep the bedsheets and the minimum wage jobs; they take the profit.  
This is called "Economic Leakage." For island economies, leakage is often 70-80%. So, Luxury hotels(which are often built by outsiders) might have 20% margins, but the profit will be transferred to the outside.  

14.8 Trillion Yen (14兆8,000億円) invested since 1972. Okinawa spent it under the justification of tourism.  
And it created the "best" industry in the prefecture that profits only 70B(700億) a year.  

### Irabu Bridge: The Trojan Horse of "Luxury Tourism."

The Irabu Bridge is not just a bridge. It is the "Patient Zero" of the luxury tourism infection.  
Opened in 2015, it connects Miyako Island to Irabu Island.  
It is free to cross. But the cost to the locals has been devastating.  

The bridge triggered the "Miyako Bubble."
Land prices skyrocketed. Rents doubled.  
Suddenly, a standard apartment became an "Investment Property" for a wealthy Tokyo investor or an Airbnb for tourists.  
Locals were pushed out of their own neighborhoods.  

**The "Luxury" Math: A Balance Sheet of Poverty**
Let's look at the impact on a local worker over the last 10 years:

| Category | The "Bubble" Reality | Monthly Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wages** | Slight increase due to labor shortage | **+ ¥40,000** |
| **Rent** | Skyrocketed (Competition with Vacation Rentals) | **- ¥60,000** |
| **Cost of Living** | "Tourist Pricing" on food & services | **- ¥15,000** |
| **NET RESULT** | **Working harder to be poorer** | **- ¥35,000 / Month** |

This is the reality of the "Tourism Kingdom."
The GDP goes up. The land price goes up. But the people get poorer.  

Miyako is becoming a **Theme Park for the Rich.**
People of Miyako will not be able to live on their island because of the theme park pricing.  

**The Ultimate Trap: Maintenance Dependency**
The Irabu Bridge costs massive amounts of money to maintain due to salt damage.  
Who pays?
The rental car companies? No.  
The luxury hotels? No.  
**You do..**
The local tax revenue cannot cover it. So, Okinawa must beg Tokyo for more subsidies to repair the bridge.  
This keeps Okinawa in a state of permanent dependency.  
We are not building assets; we are building liabilities that chain us to Tokyo forever.  

### **Luxury tourism is dangerous: Native Hawaiians can't live on the ancestor's island**

Some of you say, "Okay, cheap tourism is bad. So let's target the wealthy. Let's be like Hawaii."
So many problems here, one is that Hawaii is too close; Okinawa has to compete with Hawaii if it chooses this path.  
And the real problem is much deeper and dangerous.  

I have studied the history and economy of Hawaii extensively. On the surface, it looks like a paradise of success. But the reality for Native Hawaiians is a nightmare.  
Hawaii's prosperity is a statistical illusion of "average". 
Compared to Hawaii, Okinawa looks like paradise. I mean it. Okinawa has hope, that's why I'm writing this. Native Hawaiian has no hope.  

In Hawaii, the people who can trace their roots to the Kingdom have been reduced to a statistical minority on their own islands.  
Hawaii is not something Okinawa wants to pursue.  

In Hawaii, an unmixed-blood Hawaiian dies, on average, **22 years earlier** than the outsiders who own the mansions next door. 
Wealthy residents in top-tier US zip codes (like Kahala, part of Maui) live about 90 years. Unmixed-blood Hawaiians live about 68 years. 90 - 68 = 22 Years.  
Why? Because "Luxury Tourism" makes the cost of living lethal. They cannot afford healthy food. They cannot afford healthcare. They cannot afford to buy a home on the land their ancestors walked on.  

Look at the population data from history. When outsiders invaded, the Hawaiian Kingdom had a population eight times larger than the Ryukyu Kingdom. (Hawaii 1778: about 650K; Okinawa 1609: about 78K(exclude Amami))
Today, 1.4 million Okinawans live on the island. Okinawans are thriving on the island where their ancestors lived. 
2020 U.S. Census, only 0.2 million people identified as "Native Hawaiian alone."
Remember? They had an 8 times larger population than Ryukyu.  

Things get darker.  "The Office of Hawaiian Affairs’ (OHA) Native Hawaiian Data Book"  
[https://ohadatabook.com/Quantum-01.pdf](https://ohadatabook.com/Quantum-01.pdf)  
In 1984, only 8,244 were counted as "100% Hawaiian".  
Given the high rates of intermarriage and the aging of that specific generation, demographers and organizations generally estimate that this number has dropped below 8,000 in the decades since.  
The estimated unmixed blood native Hawaiian population today is "Fewer than 8,000". 

**"Fewer than 8,000"**

Now you know what I meant. Okinawa looks like paradise compared to Hawaii.  

You might think I'm weirdly obsessive about unmixed blood. It's because the US has a law to qualify a person's ethnicity by how thick one's blood is.  
Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). To qualify for a homestead lease, an applicant must prove they have at least 50% Native Hawaiian blood.  
They are trying to make Native Hawaiians "legally not Native Hawaiian"; this pressure exists in many forms in Hawaii, and the result is the "Fewer than 8,000".  
The system is designed to define them out of existence. If you can't afford to live there, you leave. If you mix with others, the government says you aren't 'Native' enough to claim your land. It is an assimilation machine with extra steps.  

If we succeed at 'Luxury tourism,' Okinawa just become Hawaii, where the locals can't afford to live anymore. 
Is that the dream? To be servants of the rich outsiders in the island where your ancestors lived? 

Do you think the people of Okinawa deserve that?

### **Luxury tourism is a tool of Assimilation**

We often talk about "Assimilation" as something from the past—when they banned our dialect or forced us to bow to the Emperor.  
But the modern tool of assimilation is much more efficient, and much more dangerous.  
It is the Market.  

Luxury Tourism is not just a business model; it is a **Population Replacement System.**

Look at how it works in Hawaii:
1.  The US mainlanders build luxury resorts.  
2.  Real estate prices skyrocket to match the "Global Standard."
3.  The cost of living becomes impossible for a local family.  
4.  The locals are forced to leave the island to survive.  
5.  Rich outsiders move in to buy the "Paradise."

This is what is happening in Hawaii now. This is why Hawaiian has no hope. 
It's an industry of **"passive ethnic cleansing".** 
The USA doesn't need to ban local culture. "That's ethnic cleansing, that's unethical." 
The USA just needs to make it too expensive for locals to exist.  
So they "voluntarily" leave the island.  
The market does the dirty automatically. 
"It's God's work, not the US people's intent. I'm sorry that you lost your beautiful home, Native Hawaiians. Thoughts and Prayers". 
It replaces the local people with wealthy outsiders and turns those who remain into a service class—performing "Local Culture" for the amusement of the people who replaced them.  

That is the "Luxury Tourism" strategy: The state gets rich in its balance sheet, and native locals go extinct.  

Do you think the people of Okinawa deserve that?
If you support the 'Hawaii Model,' you are not planning for Okinawa's prosperity.  
You are planning for the replacement of Okinawans.  

###  **Tourism is an excuse to not plan a real business plan**

If you have ever started a business or worked on a new B2C project, you know the first thing you should do is determine how many potential customers there are.  
The next thing you want to do is assess competitors.  
If you can't build a profitable plan after this data, the business will highly likely fail.  

Okinawa hasn't done these assessments if we assume their true intention is to improve their economy.  
Likely explanation here is that they did, and they know that tourism doesn't work.  

Tourism lets you say, "We will draw people from everywhere. Because our land is beautiful!"
It's a comfortable story. But not true. 50 years of failure is enough to prove that.  

### **Okinawa government's "plan" is... diary?**
Actually, I find their "Basic Plan" for tourism.  
I'm excited to hear the best pitch from the Tourism Prefecture of Okinawa.  
Who has been practicing tourism as its main business for 50 years, since 1975, Ocean Expo.  
They should have the proof that tourism works. Right?

* "第６次沖縄県観光振興基本計画" [https://web.archive.org/web/20250317205547/https://www.pref.okinawa.jp/_res/projects/default_project/_page_/001/011/752/6keikaku2.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20250317205547/https://www.pref.okinawa.jp/_res/projects/default_project/_page_/001/011/752/6keikaku2.pdf)

You can search 競合地の動向 (Competitor Trends) for the Okinawa government's "assessment".  

Quick summary for those who don't want to read the PDF:
This is not a "Plan."
This is a diary.  
It lacks the information that determines what action they should take.  
It was filled with wishful thinking and words.  

I looked for their "Market Assessment." I really tried.  
I read their "Basic Plan"—all (82 + 78) pages of it. (That was painful.)
I expected to see hard data.  
I expected to see *why* wealthy travelers choose Hawaii over us.  
I expected to see *who* exactly we are targeting.  
I expected to see *how* we handle drawbacks.  
I expected to see *how many* potential customers Okinawa has.  

Do you know what I found? **Nothing.**
No data. No financial comparison to Hawaii or Bali.  
No specific target other than "all travellers."
No strategy.  
No Plan.  

They have no proof that tourism works.  


###  Okinawa tourism is defeated by Fukuoka.  

This is the only meaningful data from the "第６次沖縄県観光振興基本計画" I could find.  
"2019 年都道府県別でみる外国人観光客数ランキングの上位の 10 位内に福岡県が８位（206.8 万人）、沖縄県が 10 位（172.8 万人）にランクインしている。"
It can't even defeat Fukuoka.  
Fukuoka is not even trying to be a "Tourism Kingdom".  

Apologists will say Fukuoka counts cruise ships and business travelers. But that is the point. Fukuoka has a real economy that attracts business travelers. Okinawa has only a resort economy that cannot even beat a regional city's side-hustle tourism.  
People come where real life exists; Kyoto, Tokyo, and Fukuoka are examples. Artificial tourism rarely works.  

### Statistical illusion to reframe the aid size: deceptive "Tourism is bigger than military base rent"
They don't provide proof that "tourism works."
But I find the proof that "tourism isn't working."
第5次沖縄県観光振興基本計画改定版 page 14.  

"なお、観光収入が県外受取に占める割合は 2013 年度において 19.2％であり、軍関係受取や石油製品と比較して大きな割合となっている" 
They proudly present this sentence, "See, it's the biggest!" 
No, the biggest is the external aid **50.2%**. (If we assume this document data is correct.)
They call it "県外から財政への移転". It's external aid. They don't call it aid.  

Btw, "県外受取" is a deceptive grouping; the main component is the external aid, 50.2%. They don't call it aid. 
The context suggests the concept is manufactured to say "Military base is not the biggest!"

But they are admitting the same sentence that "the biggest business is only paying a small part of what they received.  
With their made-up conceptual statistical data.  
And "近年は、概ね横ばいである。" 
The document says tourism isn't working. 

###  "その他(others)" is actually aid from Tokyo.: Stasstical deception to hide aid.  
And "その他(others)" 18.8%?, with no explanation? 
Because they don't explain it, I'll explain it. It's Social Security from Tokyo.  
They presented the data in a way that obscures the truth. By dumping huge reliance on Tokyo into vague categories like 'Others' or separating Social Security from 'Aid,' they dilute the visual impact of the dependency.  

[https://www.pref.okinawa.jp/toukeika/accounts/accounts_index.html](https://www.pref.okinawa.jp/toukeika/accounts/accounts_index.html)  
You can find it in "平成 25 年度県民経済計- 1.社会保障負担の明細表（県民ベースの家計及び雇主の支払)", which is Excel.  
The graph(from the PDF page 14)refers to 2013 data, but I only got access to 2022 data. 
* "社会保障給付: 現物社会移転以外の社会給付": 552,203 百万円 (552B)
* "社会保障給付: 現物社会移転（市場産出の購入）": 453,737 百万円 (453B)
It roughly fits with the number, and it is from Tokyo(県外), and it is directly distributed to people, so it's not "財政への移転" the 50.2%.  
And you see, they only counted one of these. likely "社会保障給付: 現物社会移転以外の社会給付". Because it likely refers to the money(non-product aid).  

Possibly, this includes the dividends from foreign assets.  
"2.制度部門別所得支出勘定 (77.5KB):　④家計（個人企業を含む: 受取: 財産所得" 209,713百万円 (209B)
But seems they are not counted in the graph.  

Also, I'm sure that they actually got more external aid in a different form. And they are not calculating that.  
And after all the bureaucratic camouflage, they still proved that tourism isn't working.  

### The profit vs. The revenue: Stasstical deception to mix different figures.
The graph from page 14 has another deceptive mechanism.  
They are mixing the profit and revenue in the same graph.  
県外から財政への移転(Fiscal Transfers): Pure Profit (Net Cash Injection)
軍関係受取(Military Rent): Pure Profit (Net Cash Injection)
その他(Social Security): Pure Profit (Net Cash Injection)
観光収入(Tourism Revenue): This is revenue, and the operational cost is so high. The actual effective number is around 8% of this value.  

They are mixing the radically different numbers to create the illusion.  
We will convert everything to **"Net Economic Gain"** (Profit/Surplus) to make them comparable.  

1.  **Fiscal Transfers (Aid):** 1,171.5 Billion Yen (100% Gain)
2.  **Other (Social Security):** 439.5 Billion Yen (100% Gain)
3.  **Military Receipts (Rent):** 208.8 Billion Yen (~100% Gain, mostly land rent)
4.  **Tourism:**
    *   *Nominal:* 447.9 Billion Yen
    *   *Real Gain (8%):* **35.8 Billion Yen**
5.  **Petroleum (Exports):**
    *   *Nominal:* 65.0 Billion Yen
    *   *Real Gain (~5% margin):* **3.3 Billion Yen**


### I fixed the graph for them. Profit comparison: Tourism only generates 1.9%; money from Tokyo and Military rent is 97.9%.  

Here is what the relative share looks like when you compare Profit to Profit:

| Category | The "Misleading" Share (from PDF) | **The "Real" Share (Recalculated)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fiscal Aid (Subsidies)** | 50.2% | **63.0%** |
| **Other (Pensions/Passive)** | 18.8% | **23.7%** |
| **Military (Rent)** | 9.0% | **11.2%** |
| **Tourism (Business Profit)** | **19.2%** | **1.9%** |
| **Petroleum** | 2.8% | **0.2%** |

*(Note: Total "Net Gain" Pot approx. 1,859 Billion Yen)
(Note: based on data from 第5次沖縄県観光振興基本計画改定版, which is based on 2013 data)

** The Conclusion **
When you fix the math:
1.  **Tourism is a rounding error.** It drops from a "Major Pillar" (19.2%) to a statistically insignificant **1.9%**.  
2.  **Military > Tourism.** Even in the PDF, they tried to claim Tourism (19%) > Military (9%). In reality, **Military Rent (11%) is 5x more profitable than Tourism Business (2%).**
3.  **The "Welfare State" Reality.** If you combine Subsidies (63%) and Pensions/Passive (24%), **87% of Okinawa's wealth comes from simply "receiving checks" from the mainland.**
4.  **External aid share is 97.9%.** Tourism practically doesn't exist from a profit perspective.  

This graph in the PDF is not just a mistake; it is fraudulent accounting designed to hide the fact that the entire tourism industry creates less net wealth for the island than the Military land rents do.  

###  They know that tourism isn't working.: but insist to go further

And we hand them **300 Billion Yen** to manage. Every year.  
They say with a straight face, "Tourism is working!"

Did they not assess the market because they are incompetent?
Or did they do it, see the dead end, and hide the result from our view?

It doesn't matter.  
The only certain thing we can get from that PDF is this:
**They have no will or skill to develop the economy of Okinawa.**

You see, no future for tourism.  
Even the Okinawa government knows it.  
The Basic Plan is the confession. They have given up.  

### Conclusion: Stop the aid. Also, stop using money on tourism.  
* The aid is one of the reasons that they use tourism to waste money.  
* Military rent alone is generating a profit 6 times higher than tourism. The combined external aid is at least 51 times bigger than the tourism profit(and "combined" does not include every external aid, since I was using Okinawa prefecture's terminology).  
* Return on Investment (ROI) is disastrous. Okinawa tourism industry's estimated operational profit is tiny ~68.2 Billion Yen(2024), despite substantial investment.  
* The Okinawa tourism can't even defeat Fukuoka in inbound. Fukuoka is not even trying to be a "Tourism Kingdom".  
* These are the result of the attempts to make tourism the best industry in Okinawa for over 50 years, with massive development aid totaling 14兆8,000億円. 
* The math simply doesn't work; It creates low-wage workers. Okinawa has too large a population to rely on tourists. Beaches are the sales point, and it's a commodity.  
* And even that beach is weak. Okinawa has winter. Competitors not.  
* Luxury tourism is a trap that Okinawa doesn't want to pursue.  
* The Okinawa government knows tourism will not work.  
* Okinawa government's official plan for tourism, "第６次沖縄県観光振興基本計画", is a confession of giving up.
