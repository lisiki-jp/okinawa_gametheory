# Solution Chapter: Building the "Unsinkable Okinawa Economy".  

We have talked enough about the problem. Let’s talk about the future.  

### Future 1. Tourism is a side business.  
As we saw in "9", it has no future.  
No investment in tourism from today.  
But, natural visitors likely stay strong. Just let the market handle it.  

### Future 2. The True Talent: "Masters of Fiction" that fuel the Creative Digital Industry.  
So, what can Okinawa sell to the world?
What natural resources of the Okinawans uniquely have?

As I told you in the history chapter, Okinawa is the **"Master of Fiction."**
Historically, they survived by hiding the truth and navigating between empires with wit and performance.  
Some call this "lying."
**I call it "Creativity."**	

What is the Entertainment Industry? What is a Movie? What is a Video Game?
It is the **Art of Deception.** It is creating a beautiful lie that people pay to experience.  
Think about the best entertainment. Shingeki no Kyojin or Game of Thrones.  
They are full of deception.  

Every good story has a struggle as a theme. 
Okinawa people know deeply about it than any other Japanese.  
They will create the stories that everyone around the world would empathize with.  

Okinawans are natural-born storytellers, performers, and creators. They have the creativity in their DNA and culture.  
"Kijimuna spirit", you might call it. It's a bit different from what I mean, but it gives a cute Trickstar vibe of Okinawa.  

We shouldn't be forcing these brilliant, creative people to serve beer to tourists.  
We should be giving them keyboards and cameras.  
**The Digital Creative Industry** is the perfect fit for the Okinawan character.  
Gaming, Anime, Software, Design.  
These are products you can sell to New York, London, and Paris instantly.  

**The Digital Creative Industry** is the only logical future for an island.  
*   **Agriculture:** Expensive to ship.  
*   **Manufacturing:** Expensive to ship.  
*   **Software/Anime/Gaming:** **Zero shipping costs.**

Software has no shipping costs. It doesn't care that Okinawa is an island. It doesn't need a deep-water port.  

### Future 3. The Physical Bottleneck: Car-free living for people and business.  
But to unleash this Digital Industry, we need the right environment.  
A Digital City requires density. Programmers, artists, and designers need to meet, mix, and collaborate.  

**The Car is the enemy of Density.**
Currently, Okinawa is a car-dependent society. 
This is a societal type that is only acceptable in a country with an abundance of space, oil, or car production. 
Okinawa has no space, no oil, and no car production.  
If you build a gaming studio with 100 creators, you need a parking lot for 100 cars.  
In Naha, where land prices are exploding, this is economic suicide. 
No digital company comes to Okinawa as long as cars are a necessity.  

**The Car is a vampire sucking the blood out of the local economy.**
Because everything has to be imported. Okinawa has no oil or car manufacturing.  
People of Okinawa have to pay billions of yen to Toyota and Saudi Arabia every year, just so people can commute.  

To build a creative city on a small island, we must kill the Car Dependency.  

### Future 4. Introduce Trains: Convert 2 lanes of Route 58 into a High-Speed Tram.  

Before I talk about this, I want to quickly mythbust "The most valuable land is taken by the US".  
Southern Plateau (where Naha is): 150 - 200 km². The US Presence is near zero.  
Central Plateau (where Kadena is): 80 - 100 km². The US Military occupies about 30-40%.  
Tokyo is the best city in Japan because it has the Kanto plain, which is the biggest plain in Japan.  
Okinawa's biggest plain is the Southern Plateau. Thus best land is Naha and its plateau. And no US there.  

The US Military occupies about 15% of the total flat land on the main island (mostly in the Central zone).  
If Okinawa can't produce the result with 85% of the land. They can't do it with an additional 15% of the land.  

So, how to make use of that 85% of the flat land?

**We need an efficient transportation system that replaces cars.**
Rail frees up the massive land wasted on parking lots.  
It is **7 to 9 times** more energy-efficient than cars. 
Rail's efficiency comes from the steel wheel. Monorail has a rubber tire, which is practically a car. Monorail is inefficient because the rubber deforms.  

We don't need to dig tunnels through mountains. We don't need to wait for the US Marines to leave.  
We have the land. It is right in front of us.  
**Route 58.**

Route 58 has 6 lanes, an American-style road that is not optimal for Okinawa.  
We will turn two lanes of Route 58 into a High-Speed Surface Railway (LRT).  
Connect Naha to Chatan in 20 minutes.  
It requires no US permission. It requires no tunnels.  
It only requires the courage to say 'No' to the Car society.  

### Future 5. The "Tax-Free" Digital Zone
Once we have the Rail, we stop the "Construction Subsidies" (The 300 Billion Yen). Entirely.  
We replace it with a **Special Tax-Free Zone.**

*   **Corporate Tax for Creative/Tech Companies:** **0%**.  
*   **Income Tax for Creators/Engineers:** **0%**.  

We use the "Aid" money to cover the tax gap.  
This will attract talent from Tokyo, Taiwan, and Singapore.  

### Future 6. dismisses the media cartel

The current generation of people of Okinawa is 'educated' from birth by local media under total control.  
The invisible hand can't fix this 'educated' market.  
The government has to intervene.  

This is important because if local media can distort reality, as they are doing now, any positive development in Okinawa can be reframed as a negative one.  
The Russian people will not change, even if Putin is gone. Okinawa is the same.  

**Public-Private Partnership for Media Pluralism**
Just as the government builds roads that anyone can drive on, the government can subsidize a "Joint Printing Center" in remote islands to ensure all newspapers (national and local) have equal access to the market.  
Any newspaper with a low local market share can use the facility at an affordable fee.  

**Market Concentration Assessment** required by laws.  
The EU recently passed the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA).  
EMFA requires member states to assess if media concentration affects 'pluralism.' 
In Okinawa, a 99% share is not just a monopoly; it is a failure of democracy. 
Japan should adopt similar 'Pluralism Thresholds' that trigger automatic government support for competitors when one entity holds over 50% of the market.  

**JFTC and Resale Price Maintenance System(再販制度)**
Japan has the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) that can address the problem.  
JFTC has a concept of Collective Dominance that can be applied to the Okinawa context.  
In economics, the Okinawa media landscape can be framed as a Cartel. They do not compete on price. They do not compete on narrative. They effectively operate as a single organism with two mouths.  
Also, newspapers are getting privileged of RPMS. 
If a newspaper, or collective, has >80% market share in a prefecture, it should lose its special legal protections until competition is restored.  

Addressing media dominance is essential, and we can take numerous measures that I can't list here. 
I leave that to you and professional regulators. 

### Future 7. The Institution: Human Resource Exchange.  
"第６次沖縄県観光振興基本計画" [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2Sjv5](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2Sjv5)   
I talked about how bad this "Basic Plan" is. In short, it's not a plan. It's at best a diary.  
After reading the PDF. I find the deeper problem. 

A healthy organization has checks and balances. Someone should have read that draft and said, "This is embarrassing. Where are the numbers? We cannot publish this."
The fact that it was approved, printed, and published means that nobody inside the building thought it was weird.  

And that PDF is about the most important business of the prefecture.  

They are in an "Echo Chamber." They only talk to each other, so they think this low standard is normal.  
The culture of the Okinawa Prefectural Government has rotted.  

This is a hard part. Changing the institutional culture is difficult.  
WE can't reeducate adults; Okinawa institutions have to exchange personnel with other prefectures.  

Okinawa needs a complete Human Resources overhaul.  
Okinawa needs to exchange its bureaucrats with other prefectures.  
Okinawa needs cold, hard eyes from the outside to be audited.  

### Future 8. The language: An International hub needs to be bilingual

This is optional.  

All Singaporeans are bilingual. 
If Okinawa chose to become an international hub, as they claim to be today, it would have to speak English.  
Potentially, the US bases can provide native English speakers. Soldiers' families are likely happy to teach English. 
You might think "There is no room" to teach English, but statistics show bilingual countries have high scores on Math and other subjects. And this aligns with my personal experience, becoming bilingual (I was 29yo when I started speaking English) has so many intellectual benefits beyond "being able to speak another language". So many I can't list here. For example, I was never able to write this report without becoming bilingual.  
It's likely beneficial to aim for bilingual, even if we consider the opportunity cost. 
Japan's English education is outdated. Okinawa can become the frontier for real English education that boosts the productivity of all of Japan.  

### Future 9. Abolish the development aid

**Stop it.**
This is the most important.  
Replace it with a tax reduction for the creative digital industry.  
It's time for Okinawa to get real economic independence.  
So we have to cut the promotion budget even if they scream. We had to.  
Of course, don't cut the regular aid that keeps the Okinawa government running.  

### Conclusion: Creative Digital Industry with beautiful Beaches
*   Okinawa stops relying on the "Cheap Beach" trade.  
*   Okinawans do not have to pay for expensive cars.  
*   Okinawans get high-paying creative jobs.  
*   The economy creates a product that China cannot switch off.  
*   Okinawa gets economic independence, and the people of Okinawa become wealthier.  
*   Okinawans will love democracy because democracy has actually provided a visible good change to them.  

**You will enjoy a beautiful beach after the creative work.**
This is the unique Okinawa that attracts talent from all over the world.

# The conclusion: Do not hunt for the villains. Retweet this report now.  

Thank you. 
I know this report was long and emotional. You must be tired.  
But you are here. You are here because you care about Japan and its people.  
This is the final chapter. 

We have walked through together.  
We have seen how our money is wasted, how our security is undermined, and how Okinawa is kept poor by design.  

We saw a bright hope that Okinawa can be the beacon of creativity, with beautiful beaches for extra.  

I want to say the most important thing:
**Do not hunt for villains.**

### Do not hunt for villains. There are no villains, just true believers who believed bad data.  

As I explained, they are doing what's best for them. And that shouldn't be punished.  
They believed they were doing the right thing. They are not evil people.  
What they did was likely portrayed as "justice" in their circle.  
Tokyo kept Okinawa poor to save all of us.  
Local media did just what corporations do, and likely most of the people inside believed that they were doing the morally right thing.  
They are just true believer that situated within a bad structure.  
And other players I didn't explain in this report are the same.  

**The evil is not in the People. The evil is in the Structure.**
All of this was legal. All of this was rational for the players involved.  
But the result was a disaster for Japan.  
So, let's not blame people and start **fixing the structure.**
We've already lost too much time and resources; we have to focus on what matters.  

And, Remember? **"The Conflict" is their business.**
That's what kept this scam alive for over 50 years.  
If we start fighting each other—Right vs. Left, Mainland vs. Okinawa—we are just giving them more time and money.  

**We will not fall for their trap anymore.**

We will not give them time to entrench.  

**We start dismantling this show today. Here and now.**

### We start now, but how?: By entering the game.  

I told you that we, "the Japanese majority," are the strongest player.  
It means **you** are the boss.  
It's true as long as we are a democratic country. And luckily, we are.  

If the majority of potential voters support ending the halmful aid, the government has to change the current policy to stay in power.  
You don't have to wait till the next election.  
**We can start today, right now.**

To make the majority support this idea, we have to deliver this idea to them.  
Japan is an old country. Not everyone has access internet, SNS, or YouTube.  
We need mass media on our side. Nationwide TVs and nationwide newspapers are necessary to secure the majority.  

### The Strategy: Setting the comfortable ground for the mass media

Japanese newspapers have a unique system that makes them loosely collective. The system is called the Kisha Club.  
If one media moves too fast, it will be punished by others.  
We need to build a condition that one media feels confident that the other media will follow the move.  

**This is where YOU come in.**

To make them feel safe. We can build a public consensus that the majority of the Japanese will support the idea.  
This can be done in two ways.  
1. Spread this idea by retweet or any means.  
2. Influential figures support this idea.  

"Spread this idea" works because this is essentially pre-voting. Who spread the idea is who likes the idea.  
He will vote for the party that aligns with the idea in the next election. 
Every Retweet, every Share, every Like is a signal.  
It tells the media: *"The wind has changed."*
It tells the politicians: *"If you don't change the policy, you will lose votes."*

"Influential figures support" is the same as "spread the idea", but with a large boost.  
Influential figures can spread the idea much faster and farther than an ordinary man.  

When mass media think, "Seems like most of the Japanese will like this idea", they will follow.  
When the government thinks, "Seems like we are going to lose the next election if we don't change the course", they will end the halmful aid.  
And to that, you should spread this idea as far as you can.  

**You are the one who pushes the First Domino.**

## My Final Request: Retweet this report now
**Retweet this now.**
If you know an influential figure—a YouTuber, a politician, a professor, a journalist, an author—send this to them.
