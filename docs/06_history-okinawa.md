# 6: "Ryukyu Kingdom was a peaceful Kingdom."

* "Ryukyu Kingdom was a great trader."
* "Ryukyu Kingdom was a utopia."

These "Beautiful Ryukyu Kingdom" stories are all fantasy.  
The historical evidence tells that 
* Ryukyu was not peaceful.
* Ryukyu was not a great trader.
* Ryukyu was not a utopia.
* Ryukyu was not sovereign from day one (1429).
* Ryukyu was not even a Kingdom in a practical sense.

### Start from the data: population growth.  
Before the story, let's see the population growth data I calculated from trustworthy data.  

| Period / Year | Regime | Pop Growth | Annual Growth | Data Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |
| **1429 - 1609** | **Ryukyu Kingdom under Ming** | 70K ➔ 86K  | 0.11% | Only main island |
| **1609 – 1880** | **Ryukyu Kingdom under Satsuma** | 100K ➔ 353K | 0.47% | Amami excluded |
| **1880 – 1935** | **Okinawa in Japan(Constitutional Monarchy)** | **353K ➔ 590k** | 0.94% | Amami excluded |
| **1880 – 2025** | **Okinawa in Japan(All)** | **353K ➔ 1,467k** | 0.99% | Amami excluded |

* (Source: 70K is a widely accepted academic estimate. Which is 60K - 80K. I took the middle.)
* (Source: 86K is based on estimation from 100K(1609, academic standard) and the 1647 Yaeyama data. Assuming Miyako has a double population of Yaeyama, which is a widely accepted standard. Assuming under Satsuma, in this case 1609 - 1647, the annual growth rate is fixed at 0.47% for all islands and the given period, back-casting the 1609 population.  I subtracted the estimated Sakishima population(1609: 14K) from 100K for the main island comparison.)
* (Source: 353K, 590K, and 1,467K are from the census by Japan, which is trustworthy. )
* (I assumed: population growth is exponential. It grows uniformly in the given period.)
* (Note: Satsuma census is unreliable; I'll explain later. I used only the data that is considered trustworthy among academics. The 100K estimation that is widely accepted is from 1632 data. 1647 Yaeyama data. 1880 is the census of the Okinawa prefecture by Japan. The Satsuma rule over Okinawa ended in 1879.)
* (Note: After the Satsuma Invasion, Amami became part of Satsuma. Population data circulating "Okinawa(Ryukyu)" has roughly three types: Amami included, Amami excluded, and only the main island counted.)

We can observe:
1. Under Ryukyu/Ming(1429 - 1609) population growth rate was low. (0.11%)
2. Under Ryukyu/Satsuma(1609 – 1880), the growth rate increased massively. (0.47%) 
3. Under Japan(1880 – 2025), the growth rate become even higher.(0.99%)

We've already dismissed "Ryukyu Utopia" and "Golden Age".  

### Pop growth under Ming(0.11%) and under Satsuma(0.47%): Resource Curse from Ming

The difference mainly comes from two things.  
1. Sweet Potato(Satsuma/Kara imo)
2. Ruler's population growth incentive. (Resource/Aid Curse vs. developing local economy)

Sweet Potato is the enabler. "Incentive" is the real driver.  

The ruler's account on population growth
* Ryukyu/Ming(1429 - 1609): No interest, wealth comes from Ming or outside, not the people. A smaller population is actually better for political reasons. 
* Ryukyu/Satsuma(1609 – 1880): As much as possible to maximize the sugar industry.  

I talked about the aid(resource) curse in previous chapters. 
**Today, Okinawa has the curse of the aid from Tokyo. Ryukyu had that as the aid from Ming.**
From the Ryukyu kings' (1429 - 1609) perspective, population is not a good resource. Weapon/wealth comes from the Ming(aid curse). Which will not be affected by how many people you have.  
The local industries matter for the King (for Ming) has a small employment cap. For example, Iwo-Tori-Shima's sulfur deposit(resource curse). If the king can fit the people on the deposit, the extra population has no benefit for maximizing his wealth. He had a highly profitable, low operational cost business.  
It's even better not to have a large population. Because it causes the undesirable power balance shift of King vs. Others. Keeping the population small and weak is the optimal choice for the King. This is symbolized by the weapon confiscation by the Ryukyu kings. 
He can secure his power by keeping the population small and weak, and maximizing the aid from the Ming by maximizing the goods flow(mainly sulfur) to the Ming, which can be done without the local people's labor. Trade(which is enabled by Ming) is the same; they don't need labor. 
In short, Ryukyu's low growth rate (0.11%) is the result of the resource/aid curse.  
This is a usual behavior of "Rentier State Autocrat".  

Ryukyu/Satsuma(1609 – 1880) period, Satsuma wanted to create a sugar industry in Ryukyu, which needed manpower to run.  
That's the reason.  
Satsuma needed to develop the local population/industry, but Ryukyu was not.  

### Pop growth under Satsuma (0.47%) vs. Japan (0.99%): Tax Reform & The End of Internal Colonialism

The doubling of the growth rate under modern Japan was driven by the dismantling of the Ryukyu Kingdom's punitive tax structure.  

**1. Ryukyu/Satsuma Era: The "Head Tax" (Nintōzei) Penalty**
While Satsuma demanded the tribute, it was the Ryukyu Kingdom (Shuri) that designed the collection system. Acting as a colonial power toward its own periphery, the Shuri government protected the Main Island peasantry by shifting the heaviest fiscal burden onto the "culturally distinct" Sakishima Islands.  
*   **The Mechanism:** The Head Tax (*Nintōzei*) charged a fixed amount per person, regardless of harvest success.  
*   **The Incentive:** This turned every child into a **Fixed Liability**. In a region plagued by typhoons, a new mouth to feed was a guaranteed debt that threatened the family's solvency.  
*   **The Result:** To survive, families were forced into **infanticide** (*Mabiki*). The tax system acted as a structural "population brake," compelling the poor to cull their own numbers to mitigate the risk passed down from Shuri.  

**2. Japan Era: The Shift from Liability to Asset**
The Meiji government eventually abolished the Head Tax (fully by 1903) and replaced it with a modern Land Tax.  
*   **The Reform:** Taxation was no longer based on *existence*, but on *land value*.  
*   **The Incentive:** This reversed the economic logic of the family. A child transformed from a "Tax Object" into a **Labor Asset**. More children meant more hands to work the sugar cane fields, increasing the family's surplus income.  
*   **The Boom:** With the state no longer penalizing reproduction, the population naturally corrected upward. The jump to 0.99% growth wasn't just about better medicine; it was the economic rationalization of survival.  

### Our observation aligns with history: Under Ryukyu, commoners suffered; under Japan, they were liberated.  

The statistics of population growth tell one story, but the historical records of **Inamura Kenpu** (a Miyako-born historian) tell the human story.  

**1. The "Voice of Joy" (1903)**
In his book *Miyakojima Shominshi*(宮古島庶民史), Inamura records the moment the Head Tax was finally abolished by the Japanese government in 1903. The reaction was not one of mourning a lost kingdom, but of explosive liberation.  
*   The people of Miyako celebrated, danced, drank for **"3 days and 3 nights."**
*   Inamura writes that the **"Voice of Joy"** was so loud it shook the ground.  
This celebration marks the true end of the "Internal Colonialism" that began under the Ryukyu Kings.  

**2. The Battle for Abolition: Reformers vs. The Old Guard**
[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E6%9D%91%E5%8D%81%E4%BD%9C
](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E6%9D%91%E5%8D%81%E4%BD%9C)  
The path to this liberation reveals who the real oppressors were.  
*   **The Heroes:** The movement was led by **Nakamura Jusaku** (a Japanese Mainlander from Niigata) and **Gusukuma Seian** (an Okinawan from Naha). They joined forces with peasant leaders to petition the government.  
*   **The Villains:** Who fought to keep the tax? It was the **Former Ryukyu Samurai (Shuri Gentry)**.  
    *   As detailed in Higa Chuncho’s *History of Okinawa*, the local bureaucrats—the remnants of the Ryukyu feudal class—actively petitioned the Imperial Diet *against* the peasants.  
    *   **Their Argument:** They argued that *"The people of Sakishima are of a lower level of civilization... the Head Tax is the only way to make them work."*
*   **The Reality:** The Ryukyu elite fought to maintain the suffering of their own people to protect their administrative privileges.  

**3. The Role of Modern Japan**
This history contradicts the modern narrative that "Mainland Japan" has always been the enemy of the Okinawan people.  
*   **Collaboration:** Liberation was achieved by Mainlanders (Nakamura), Okinawans (Gusukuma), and the Media (the *Yomiuri Shimbun*, led by Masuda Giichi) working together against the feudal Old Guard.  
*   **Result:** Despite harassment from the police and the Shuri elite, the petition reached Minister Inoue Kaoru, and the tax was abolished.  

The population boom that followed wasn't an accident; it was the direct result of this liberation. The "Voice of Joy" in 1903 confirms that for the common people of Miyako, modernization was not oppression—it was survival.  

### Is Nakamura Saint?: Likely not, he is a businessman who needs healthy labor

We should not romanticize the reformers as pure saints. Nakamura Jusaku was a businessman who needed a mobile, healthy labor force for the modern pearl and sugar industries. However, this proves the point: Modern economic incentives are aligned with the survival of the population. The Feudal/Colonial system viewed the population as a liability to be taxed into starvation; the Modern/Capitalist system viewed them as a resource to be developed. Whether out of altruism or profit, the modern system stopped the infanticide.  

There is no saint in our world; incentives can make people act like a saint or an evil person.  

### Incentives can make people act as saints or act as evil.  

There are no true saints or devils in our world. Only actors responding to the world around them. Incentives can drive a businessman to act like a savior, just as they can drive a King to act like a tyrant.  

The history of Ryukyu already teaches us a crucial lesson: If the incentive structure is flawed, even a benevolent ruler will produce suffering. If the structure is sound, even a greedy merchant can bring liberation.  

### Why we need to know Okinawa's history: We need an honest talk based on good data.  

Understanding real history is important because bad data is the source of misunderstanding(both Okinawa and mainland Japan), which makes real talks hard.  
Because we believe bad data. We assume the other side is lying when the stories contradict. 
It makes the opposite side look evil. Because we want to believe that "We are on the right side. Only we know the truth."

Understanding the history of Okinawa gives us a fair assessment of what Ryukyu, Satsuma, and Japan did.  
Also, Okinawa's history is more important than you think. All Japanese should be familiar with it.  

### Okinawa's history is important than you think

You think Okinawa is a tiny substory compared to mainland Japan (e.g., Sengoku-Jidai).  
Yes, Okinawa is physically tiny.  
But its importance is not.  

The most influential thing Japan did in its history is the "Modernization"(Westernization).  
And without Okinawa, no modernization.  

Modernization was an unthinkable achievement. And still feels unachievable, there were so many points of failure, and we successfully navigated the slim path.
It's safe to say we are on an "unlikely world line".  

One of the things that modernization requires is "Swift Revolution".  
Revolution is required because the old elites have to go. You can't implement radical reform that modernization demands if the powerful backward elite blocks it. (as we saw in Nakamura Juusaku's Wikipedia, Samurai blocked the tax reform, and after the tax reform, Miyako's population skyrocketed)
Swiftness is required because if the revolution is slow, European powers will intervene and "Divide and Conquer" it. India was fragmented, and that's one of the reasons why it was colonized. 

Satsuma was the driving force behind the "Swift Revolution". Satsuma's military might is the key to the swiftness.  
And what created the Satsuma military?
It's Okinawa's sugar.  

If Okinawa doesn't exist, no modernization of Japan. 
Very likely. We would've ended up like Qing China. The ruling class resisted radical adaptation (because it would wipe out their political power) and would be slowly conquered and exploited by Europeans. And we don't have the geographical depth that China had. So the result is likely worse than China.  

If we failed modernization. The world looks radically different from Today. 
At that time, we were the only ones left on earth that had the potential to perform modernization and "Giant Killing" like the Russo-Japanese War(1905).  
The world would likely be 100% colonized by Europeans. At that time, 84%(officially, reality is more stark) of the Earth was already under European control.  
There will be no proof of "Non-European can defeat first-class European power" until much later. Colonialism and White supremacy would have persisted much longer than our history did.  

We are here because of Okinawa.  

### Population data: Satsuma-Ryukyu partners in crime.: Tax-Evading Bros
"薩摩藩と近世琉球国の人口" by 尾口義男 page 8.  
[https://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/ab23/reimeikan/siroyu/documents/6757_20220514171645-1.pdf](https://www.pref.kagoshima.jp/ab23/reimeikan/siroyu/documents/6757_20220514171645-1.pdf)  
You see the beautiful table. But the data is unreliable. (Not to blame the author, he did a great job.)
Only the last two rows are trustworthy.  

Look at the last three rows, the population exploded in 4 years, between 1876-1880. 167k -> 356k. 
Suddenly, 189K babies from 83k females in 4 years? Maybe possible, if they try really hard. But statistically impossible. 
Now look at the little bit upper row, 1852. The population is 132K, which is the lowest point.  

The Meiji Restoration was in 1868. The lowest point data is from 1852, which is the last census before the revolution. Satsuma defeated the Shogun with the Okinawa Sugar Army.  
Just before the revolution, Satsuma told Edo that Okinawa was economically struggling and suffering from famine.  
Satsuma wanted to hide the real prosperity of Okinawa, that is, funding his military.  

Yes, people were there, but they are not documented in the Satsuma record. And they are documented in local Okinawa records. For example, local family records.  
Under Satsuma, the population secretly grew (estimated annually at 0.56%). 
Fueled by sweet potato(Kara-imo, Satsuma-imo), which can be grown in harsh conditions and has high calories. Compared to millet, which the Okinawa people relied upon.  
The incentive of the rulers who need manpower to grow sugar cane played an even bigger role.  
Satsuma in power(1880): "Oh, Okinawa actually had 189k more people who produced sugar. I DIDN'T KNOW IT." 

The hidden(from official records) people are called Yadori among academics.  
The academics' (experts on Okinawa) consensus is that Yadori is the Okinawan people's initiative. That Satsuma is deceived.  

But as we saw in the PDF, Satsuma was likely a partners in crime. That was a perfect way to hide the true Satsuma prowess from Edo.  
Ryukyu Samurai can get some share, and Ryukyu commoners can evade the normal tax.  
They collaborated to evade tax. 

And that alliance is what defeated the Shogun in the end.  
The "Tax-Evading Bros" funded the Modernization of Japan.  

### Who brought the sugar to Okinawa?: It was actually Satsuma.  

It's officially an Okinawan. Gima Shinjo.  
But reality is more complex.  
And **the short answer is Satsuma**.  

*   **~400 BCE:** Mentions of sugar cane juice in poems (the Chu Ci).  
*   **100:** Sugar cane was cultivated in Southern China.  
*   **608:** First recorded informal contact believed to have occurred between China and Ryukyu.  
*   **1372:** Formal relations begin; the Chuzan Kingdom becomes a tributary state of the Ming Dynasty.  
*   **1392:** The Ming sends the "36 Families" from Fujian to Ryukyu to manage diplomacy, trade, and navigation (establishing the community of Kumemura).  
*   **1609:** The Satsuma Domain (Japan) invades Ryukyu, turning it into a vassal state.  
*   **1623:** **Sugar cane is officially introduced to Ryukyu.** (Gima Shinjō introduces the crop and manufacturing techniques from Fujian).  

At that time, sugar cane had been cultivated for over 1500 years in China.  
And Okinawa had connections with China's exact place where sugar cane is produced. (Fujian)
Then nothing happened for over 1500 years.  

14 years after Satsuma, Ryukyu officially got sugar cane.  
Something they didn't do over 1500 years, they suddenly started after Satsuma.  

And it's more likely, a small cultivation of sugar cane might have existed long before Gima. Because usually crop spreads in informal contact(e.g., merchants or sailors). 
The "official introduction" was likely the start of industrialization initiated(or influenced) by Satsuma.  
And southern China(Fujian in this context), where Okinawa had a contact, is the sugar cane production center in China. 
There is no way the crop didn't spread for over 1500 years.  

### Who created the Ryukyu Kingdom?: It was actually Ming to get Japanese Sulfur.  

The official history credits officially an Okinawan. Sho Hashi, the King of Chuzan.  
But reality is more complex.  
And **the short answer is Ming**. 

How? By providing an iron weapons monopoly.  
Why? To secure sulfur without worrying about piracy (Wokou).  
The goal was to create a "Ming Dejima"—a controlled buffer zone to extract Japanese resources while banning Japanese people.  


*   **1371:** Ming Dynasty declares the **Haijin (Sea Ban)**. China banned trade with Japan, but still wants Japanese sulfur for gunpowder.  
*   **1372:** Ming made Chuzan a tributary state. One of the initial conditions was to **send sulfur to Ming**, 1,000 kin. At this time, Iwo-Tori-shima is not Chuzan's territory.  
*   **1392:** Ming sends the **36 Families** (Kumemura) to Chuzan. This is "Consultants" and stuffing the foreign office. 
*   **1429:** Chuzan wipes out **Nanzan and Hokuzan** (competitors). Enabled by Chinese iron weapons. Okinawa has zero iron mines. Only Chuzan has an iron weapon.  
*   **1429:** Start of the so-called "Great Trade Era". They export "Japanese sulfur" to China.  

The Ingredient: Gunpowder is 75% Saltpeter, 15% Charcoal, and 10% Sulfur.  
China has Saltpeter.  
China has Charcoal.  
China lacked high-quality Volcanic Sulfur. 
The answer was Japanese Sulfur. And also, Okinawa had Iwo-Tori-shima, which is a Volcanic Sulfur deposit. 

Between 1372 and 1450, Ryukyu exported tens of tons of sulfur to China. It was, by volume, one of their biggest exports.  

Ming wanted a centralized trade as the Shogunate did. One of the reasons is piracy. It's easy to protect/control one route.  
Creating the "Ming's Dejima" was the strategy of the Ming to counter piracy (Wakou).  

Work like this 
1.  **Ming** hates Japan and pirates but needs Sulfur.  
2.  **Ming** bans Japan. and made **Chuzan** a tributary to create the entrance of Japanese Sulfur. Ming only had to protect this single trade route against piracy(Wakou).  
3.  **Ming** send iron weapons to **Chuzan**.  
4.  **Chuzan** exploited the **iron weapon monopoly** to unify Okinawa.  
5.  **Chuzan** sends the Volcanic Sulfur (from the Japan Honshu/Ryukyu arc) to China.  
6.  **Ming** pays Chuzan in Porcelain/Silk/Coins.  
7.  **Ming** uses Sulfur to make gunpowder to shoot the Japanese Pirates.  

And if a Ryukyu ship carrying sulfur gets attacked by pirates on the way to China? 
That is Ryukyu's loss, not the Emperor's.  
The Ming effectively outsourced the logistics risk to Chusan.  

### Ryukyu is never had been soverign in practical sense. 

It was all Ming's doing.  
That was business of Ming. Whatever legal difinition is.  
Ming was the boss who decide what Ryukyu do, and Ryukyu "King" was just a local manager who got business licence.  

### Ryukyu is not even Kingdom in usual sense

Famouse Kingdoms c. 1600 

| No. | Kingdom / Empire | Largest Extent Area | Peak Population | **Area relative to Ming** | **Pop. relative to Ming** |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Ming Dynasty** | **6,500,000 km²** | **160,000,000** | **100% (Baseline)** | **100% (Baseline)** |
| 2 | **Spanish Empire** | 13,700,000 km² | ~30,000,000 | **211%** (2.1x larger) | **19%** (1/5th size) |
| 3 | **Mughal Empire** | 4,000,000 km² | 150,000,000 | **62%** | **94%** |
| 4 | **Russian Tsardom** | 5,500,000 km² | 14,000,000 | **85%** | **9%** |
| 5 | **Ottoman Empire** | 5,200,000 km² | 35,000,000 | **80%** | **22%** |
| 6 | **Safavid Empire** | 2,850,000 km² | 10,000,000 | **44%** | **6%** |
| 7 | **Holy Roman Empire**| 1,000,000 km² | 25,000,000 | **15%** | **16%** |
| 8 | **Polish-Lithuanian**| 1,000,000 km² | 11,000,000 | **15%** | **7%** |
| 9 | **Kingdom of France**| 500,000 km² | 20,000,000 | **8%** | **12.5%** |
| 10 | **Tokugawa Shogunate**| 370,000 km² | 30,000,000 | **6%** | **19%** |
| 11 | **Ryukyu Kingdom** | 2,270 km² | 100,000 | **0.03%** | **0.06%** |

It's the same with calling a 10-year-old boy who play baseball "baseball player".  
Yes technicaly.  
But not what you imagine when you hear "baseball player".  
You imagine the famouse one like Shohei Ohtani.

The "Kingdom" title was given by Ming to run Dejima business.
Calling Ryukyu "Kingdom" is a deceptive grouping to distort the perceived reality of the readers.

### **Sotetsu-Jigoku is not a hell.** It was a Recession
Let’s look at the population statistics of Okinawa Prefecture.  
[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B2%96%E7%B8%84%E7%9C%8C%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%A3%E7%B5%B1%E8%A8%88
](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B2%96%E7%B8%84%E7%9C%8C%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%A3%E7%B5%B1%E8%A8%88)  
The term Sotetsu-Jigoku (Cycad Hell) usually refers to the economic crisis around 1920–1930, following the collapse of sugar prices after WWI.  
This term, along with "Black Sugar Hell," should be renamed. Using the word "Hell" is an insult to those who endured actual historical hells.  

As I have explained, Okinawa's history is full of overstated, or even manufactured, victimhood. This narrative is incentivized by ideological, political, and economic reasons.  
The narrative ignores the fact that under the "benevolent" Ryukyu Kingdom, growth was stagnant (0.11%). Yet, under the so-called "oppressive" Satsuma (0.47%) and Japan (0.99%), the population boomed.  

Let’s look at the data again. Between 1920 and 1935—the exact era known as "Cycad Hell"—the population of Okinawa increased from 571k to 590k.  

Do you know what real "Hell" looks like?
*   **Holodomor (Ukraine):** Millions dead. The population collapsed.  
*   **Irish Potato Famine:** 1 million dead, 1 million fled. Population halved.  
*   **Kyoto during the Great Famine:** Streets filled with corpses.  
*   **China's The Great Leap Forward**: caused a devastating famine in China, with death toll estimates of 15 million - 55 million people.  
*   **Native Hawaiian under the US:** Full blooded native Hawaiians had an estimated 650,000 population (1778, before the Europeans). In 1984, they were reduced to only 8,244.  

In Okinawa's "Hell," the population grew.  
Why? Because it wasn't a famine, it wasn't hell; it was a recession. 
And unlike the Ryukyu Kingdom era, people weren't trapped. They had **Freedom of Movement**. They went to Osaka. They went to Brazil. They went to Hawaii. They worked abroad and sent money back home to support their families.  

If you call a period of population growth "Hell," you are insulting the people who survived actual genocides. The term "Sotetsu Jigoku" is an emotional label used to victimize Okinawa's history, ignoring the fact that modern Japanese rights (freedom of movement) saved them from the fate of a real feudal famine.  

### Analyze the Okinawa Government's official story: Spoiler, it's a fantasy
Let's see the authorized story from the Okinawa Government. 
Because it has to be valid. Right?
To learn history, we should refer to a valid source. Right?

This is the official page of from Okinawa prefecture government "History Summary." The first result on Google when I searched "沖縄 歴史".  
It's a web archive because it'll likely be modified if this report becomes viral.  
https://ghostarchive.org/archive/7orrA (mirror: https://archive.md/AitCN)

### The first line of the Official Story "Peaceful Kingdom": Not ture

> 昔、沖縄県は、琉球とよばれた一つの国でした。1429年、尚巴志という人物が、各地の有力者を一つにまとめました。

Beautiful story, I can see that the charismatic peace-loving king united the islands through his talk.  
It sounds just like how Genghis Khan "united" the Eurasian steppe.  

"Wait," you might ask. "Did Genghis Khan create his empire by talking?"
You are right. I confused you. 
Sho Hashi wasn't a peaceful negotiator. Think of him as Genghis Khan in Okinawa. He united the main island through iron.  

But who confused you is actually the Okinawa government.
It describes him as a "Peaceful negotiator", but the fact is he was a "Ruthless invader."

Using 有力者 is skillful rhetoric here. This implies interaction between the king and the person. It means a social interaction between the two, which is not what happened.   
What happened is the conquest.  

Sho Hashi was Chusan's king, who controlled Naha, where the best port was.  
Since Okinawa has no iron mine, only he can get iron weapons in mass from China.  
Using that Chinese iron, Chuzan slaughtered his competitors (Nanzan and Hokuzan).  
This is the year 1429. Only the main island is the territory.  

After the occupation solidified, Ryukyu invaded smaller islands to conquer or to make them tributaries. 
Smaller islands had no choice because Chusan(now Ryukyu) is bigger and had iron weapons. 
That was death, conquered, or tribute. Like Genghis Khan did.  
The conquest of Yonaguni wasn't completed until 1522. And that's the largest extent of the Ryukyu empire.  

Now you can see so many problem in "昔、沖縄県は、琉球とよばれた一つの国でした。1429年、尚巴志という人物が、各地の有力者を一つにまとめました。" 
1. Simply false. 1429, He didn't "unite" "Okinawa". Only the main island became Ryukyu.  
2. It's misleading. "有力者を一つにまとめました" is not the expression of military conquest.  
3. It was never "united" in the usual sense. Even if only counting Amami, they revolted in 1466(the first conquest), 1537, and 1571.  
4. It ignores everything before the Ryukyu Kingdom. It is as if the first page of Japanese history read: 'Long ago, Japan was a single country called the Tokugawa Shogunate'. It's an insult to the deep history of Okinawa.  

### The second line of the Official Story, "Trade Kingdom": No, it was actually Ming's "Dejima"
> 首里城を王国の中心とした琉球は、さかんに中国や日本、アジアの国々に出かけていき、たくさんの品物の売り買いを行いました。そのころの那覇の港は、海外から運ばれた物や外国人であふれたといわれます。この時代は「大交易時代」とよばれています。琉球は、「レキオ」という名前で、ポルトガルの資料にも記録されています。

We already talked about it in this chapter. "Who created the Ryukyu Kingdom?"
So, this myth is false.  

A true Trading Kingdom requires two things:
* Commercial Dominance: You move the goods.  
* Naval Supremacy: You protect the routes.  

Venice, Genoa, Carthage, the Dutch Republic, the British Empire. These were true Trading Kingdoms.  
Which thrived because of trade.  
Trade is the lifeline. They have to protect it.  

Ryukyu had no standing navy. They were not "moving goods" through their own commercial power; they were moving goods because China allowed them to.  

And Ryukyu didn't thrive. 
They claim they did, but a thriving trading kingdom would never be defeated by financially broken Satsuma by naval invasion.  
Mongol invasions failed because that was a naval invasion. Even the strongest empire at that time couldn't succeed it. The defense side has a massive advantage. It is considered the most difficult type of military campaign.  
And trade kingdom is best at naval warfare. It just doesn't make sense.  

In fact, Japan at that time was much better qualified as a "Trade Kingdom".  
When the Portuguese in Macau killed Japanese sailors in the "Nossa Senhora da Graça incident" (1610), the Daimyo Arima Harunobu blockaded the harbor, attacked the Portuguese ship for days, and blew it up. This is what a Trading Kingdom looks like.  
A country with no navy can't do business overseas; that's the reality.  

Ryukyu was "allowed" to trade because China let them. Ryukyu was a Dejima of the Ming.  
Okinawa government's official story ignores that fact.  

And people started to ignore the ban; Ryukyu lost its role as a warehouse.  
The Okinawa Government calls it the "Great Trade Era."
A more accurate name would be the "Great Warehouse Era."

### "Plausible deniability" of "for child" on pref.okinawa.jp

We did just 2 lines. But I think that was enough to give you the idea.  
The official story is a fantasy.  

Let's move to meta-analysis.  

Okinawa gov's page was the first result on Google when I searched "沖縄 歴史".  
And the Okinawa government's page seems relatively new; it's from 2024. 
They created this page recently. It's safe to say they want to push this narrative.  

If you are keen, you realized the URL of the page has "kodomo" in it.  
Yes, officially, the page is for a "child".  

So you might think that "inaccuracy is because the page is designed for children".  
It's a good point.  

The Okinawa government actually has pages for "adult" too.  
You can't reach that page from Google by the usual "沖縄 歴史". You have to search "site:pref.okinawa.jp 歴史"
The terrifying first half is just telling Google to search from the Okinawa prefecture website.  
This proves two things:
1. Inaccessibility: No normal person will ever find the "Adult" page.  
2. SEO Manipulation: The "Child" page is designed to be the only result everyone sees.  

Here is the link. It was created in 2024(at least that they claim), the same as a "Child" version.  
"沖縄の歴史と文化8" [https://archive.is/UwAT1](https://archive.is/UwAT1)

Don't worry. That's the right page. You are seeing the right page. 
It's just a picture of trees, you think. Yes, it's just a picture of trees, I think.  

You see, "adult" history pages are low-quality pictures.  
It's from the book "沖縄の歴史と文化" published in 2000/3/31 by 沖縄県教育委員会
One picture = one page = one webpage. Total 81 pages.  
There is zero text data. Just images.  
As a former Web Engineer (SRE), this is one of the worst implementations I have ever seen.  
It is what we call "Anti-SEO" design.  

"Anti-SEO" means the content structure is so terrible that search engines (e.g., Google) do not prefer to list the page.  
"Anti-SEO" is useful when the website owner satisfies these 3 conditions at the same time.  
1. They are legally(or any reason) required to publish the page.  
2. Wants to hide the page from public view 
3. Don't want to totally block the search engine. (which would be too obvious)

And from the perspective of Accessibility (a11y), the Okinawa Government is **violating** guidelines. 
Government websites are legally required to be accessible to the blind. (JIS X 8341-3)
The pictures can't be read by screen readers.  
This also helps to score the webpage as not preferred by Google.  

You see how Okinawa prefecture has archived the practically inaccessible history pages for the "adult" by design.  
"Child" page is a good SEO design(it's well structured text, URL is an official Japanese prefecture), where everyone comes.  
And because usually Google search lists only one page from one domain, if the "Child" page has relatively good SEO, it will be the only page Google lists.  

** So, why do they do this?**
This is a tactic called "plausible deniability" in politics. Or just "deniability" for short.  
By creating the practically inaccessible "adult" page with accurate history, they can shield themselves from criticism for the "child" page being inaccurate.  
Work like this.  
1. A professor criticizes the webpage for inaccuracy.  
2. The Okinawa government says, "It's for children, we have an accurate version for adults too!"
So they can spread the inaccurate history while being immune to criticism.  

No normal person will reach the accurate version.  
Only the inaccurate version became the truth, because it's from the Okinawa government authority.  

### Proof of the intent: selective image quality 

You might think, "Maybe the Okinawa government is just bad at making websites."
Maybe. 
Let's dive deeper to find out.  

* "沖縄の歴史と文化19" [https://archive.is/J2rQT](https://archive.is/J2rQT)
* "沖縄の歴史と文化30" [https://archive.md/WFHqh](https://archive.md/WFHqh) (mirror: [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Ioboq](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Ioboq))
* **"沖縄の歴史と文化31"** [https://archive.md/uxBAE](https://archive.md/uxBAE) (mirror: [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2Sjv5](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/2Sjv5))
* "沖縄の歴史と文化32" [https://archive.is/a6mLp](https://archive.is/a6mLp) (mirror: [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bwF5N](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bwF5N))
* "沖縄の歴史と文化81" [https://archive.md/5zDxS](https://archive.md/5zDxS) (mirror: [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/acCr9](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/acCr9))

You notice that all pages are hard to read.  
But "沖縄の歴史と文化31" is exceptionally harder to read.  

1. "沖縄の歴史と文化19", "沖縄の歴史と文化30", "沖縄の歴史と文化32", and other "Safe" pages 
    *   **Estimated Resolution:** ~200 DPI (dots per inch).  
    *   **Text Sharpness:** Relatively High. The edges of the Kanji are crisp. You can clearly distinguish complex strokes (like in "琉球石灰岩").  
    *   **Contrast:** High. The text is **Black**, and the background is **White**.  
    *   **Compression:** Low. There are very few "blocks" or digital noise around the letters.  
    *   **Verdict:** discourage reading.  

2. "沖縄の歴史と文化31": The "Dangerous" page (Dismantling the myth) 
    *   **Estimated Resolution:** ~72 DPI (or lower), possibly upscaled.  
    *   **Text Sharpness:** Very Low. The edges are fuzzy. The serifs on the Mincho font are disappearing.  
    *   **Contrast:** Low. The text is **Dark Gray** and the background is **Muddy Gray**.  
    *   **Compression:** Severe. You can see "JPEG Artifacts" (blocking) all over the text. It looks like it was saved at "Quality: 10%".  
    *   **Verdict:** **extremely discourage reading.**

"沖縄の歴史と文化31" is the lowest quality image I can find from the "adult" pages.  

### **The quality difference is evidence of their intent and digital competence**: only the dangerous page is blurry.  

They made the image blurry. Only 沖縄の歴史と文化31 is blurry.  
If they have no idea what they are doing, why is only the page specifically dangerous for their propaganda blurry?

This is the ultimate proof of "Okinawa government wants to hide true history."
This is a real example of the attempt to hide the history.  

You can see what I mean if you examine the blurry "沖縄の歴史と文化31".  

### edit: only the dangerous (for their propaganda) page snapshot is immediately deleted from web.archive.org by the owner

"沖縄の歴史と文化8" 
[https://web.archive.org/web/20250808012416/https://www.pref.okinawa.jp/bunkakoryu/bunkageijutsu/1009556/1009653/1009658/1002497/1002504.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808012416/https://www.pref.okinawa.jp/bunkakoryu/bunkageijutsu/1009556/1009653/1009658/1002497/1002504.html)
The safe one is still working.  
but the dangerous "沖縄の歴史と文化31" is deleted in a **single** day.  
The Okinawa government is actively (daily) trying to erase the evidence.  
I did it twice, and it was deleted twice in a day.  

I don't have the evidence that they deleted it, since it's gone. 
But you can snapshot "沖縄の歴史と文化31" on web.archive.org, and see if it would be deleted.  
The original page domain owner can request the deletion of the page. The Okinawa government is the domain owner.  

I re-save the pages from the "Archive.today" and ghostarchive.org, which have a reputation for being resilient for taken down.  
I also recorded the pages by "ArchiveWeb.page" and saved them as .wacz on my machine as legal proof. I will back this up in the cloud. And might publish, but it also risks of taken down, and the file might contain the data that identifies me(because it records every communication from my browser to the page), so I'm a bit hesitant. 

**Solution: I need your help**  
If you spot the image quality difference in page 沖縄の歴史と文化30, 沖縄の歴史と文化31, and 沖縄の歴史と文化32 (that means the pref didn't edit the pages when I wrote this, you can also use mirros I provided, if it's not deleted yet), take a screenshot of the difference. And spread it online.  
This works because if a single man takes a screenshot and uploads it, he might have used Photoshop to fabricate the evidense. But if numerous people provide similar results, it's hard to argue that it is photoshopped. 

沖縄の歴史と文化31 is the original book's page 30. You should be able to find it (the National Diet Library likely has it) if you are reading this in the distant future.  
Original book: "沖縄の歴史と文化" published in 2000/3/31 by 沖縄県教育委員会

### "Why is the tree clearer than the King?": because King tells the truth that denies the Fantasy Ryukyu

Such a disgrace, isn't it? Should they be proud to present their king's 4K image?

The reason is obvious if you are familiar with Ryukyu's history. 
"沖縄の歴史と文化31" has too many inconvenient truths in it.  

**この繁栄の背景には冊封・朝貢体制を築いていた明国の海禁政策があります。**  
-> * This dismisses the "Great Trade kingdom" by the Ryukyu initiative. That was just the result of Ming's policy. 

**1. 地方按司（=有力者）からの武器の没収と首里城下への移住**  
-> * This dismisses the "Peaceful Ryukyu people that voluntarily discarded weapons".* And "Satsuma taken away weapons", which is popular with combined with Karate. 

**2. 身分制度の確立**  
-> * This dismisses the "Ryukyu Utopia," The Third Pillar of Ryukyu identity*. Most people are treated as serfs(slaves in modern standard, servants), the property of the King. And the majority was a "servant of a servant/Yaa-nin" who had almost zero rights. 

**3. 聞得大君/ノロ**  
-> * This is "Police State" *,  The king converted Noro (local priest) into his surveillance camera.  

**4. 八重山や与那国における反乱を鎮め、離島の支配の強化（5代目尚元王の代には奄美諸島も配下に置く）**  
-> *This dismisses the "Peaceful Ryukyu Kingdom"*, it was a colonial empire. And it shows Amami was conquered by 5代目尚元王, contradicting the 1429 Kingdom "united" narrative.  

Page 31 lists the facts that the "Okinawa Cartel" is desperate to hide.  

### Tokyo government vs. Okinawa Cartel on pref.okinawa.jp: Bureaucratic Battle

So, the next question is, "Why does the Okinawa government have to show this image?"
We saw that they clearly don't want to show this to us. But there is, why?

You might notice the pictures are pages from a book.  
[https://archive.md/5zDxS](https://archive.md/5zDxS) (mirror: [https://ghostarchive.org/archive/acCr9](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/acCr9))  
It's created by "沖縄県教育委員会".  
The committee has Okinawa in its name, but they can't publish without 文部科学省(MEXT)'s approval.  
So, "沖縄の歴史と文化31" is **Tokyo-approved** history.  

Likely story is here. Although I have no concrete evidence.  
1. The Okinawa Government had its propaganda page.  
2. Tokyo complains about it and forces them to "show the Tokyo-approved one".  
3. The Okinawa Government renamed the propaganda page as "for children". And created a Tokyo-approved page with blurry images nobody will see.  
4. The Okinawa Government: "I followed your direction. I might not be good at the web, but I swear I did my best."
5. The Okinawa Government successfully dodges Tokyo's intention. <- **this is now**.  

Btw, Tokyo-approved history doesn't tell you everything. They hide things, too.  
But rarely tell you "lies", at least compared to Cartel-approved history.  

For example, the Tokyo-approved pages "沖縄の歴史と文化" also don't tell Ryukyu's Sakishima islands invasion, which happened in real history.  
The likely reason is that the Sakishima Islands are sensitive to Tokyo (Japan), too.  
The 1880 negotiations between Japan and Qing China had a high likelihood that the island would become a territory of Qing China. 
If Sakishima was not part of the "Ryukyu Kingdom", that would complicate things for Tokyo, too.  
So Tokyo and Cartel can shake hands on the Sakishima(Miyako, Yaeyama) topic. Beautiful. 

### Political risk that idealizes the Ryukyu: China ownership

Okinawa is genetically, linguistically, culturally, historically, internationally, and legally Japan.  
But as I explained in this chapter, the Ryukyu Kingdom is the result of Ming's action.  

If people think "Okinawa = Ryukyu" (which is not true, Okinawa is deeper than that), this enables the narrative that China is the real owner of the islands.  
All of us should accept what happened, what the real Okinawa is, and we should move on from "Ryukyu = Okinawa".  

End the Ryukyu worship that ignores the real history.  
Without the right understanding of the situation, no progress.  
As Sun Tzu said, "Know the Enemy and Yourself, you will not know defeat". (Not a great choice?)

### Conclusion: Stop the aid.  
* The aid provides the structure that the creation of hateful nationalism thrives, promoting inaccurate history.  
* Give Okinawa a real history education.  
* The Okinawa govt is promoting inaccurate history. 
* Ryukyu was practically the Dejima of Ming, created by Ming to get Japanese sulfur.  
* Ryukyu was a colonial empire.  
* Ryukyu was a terrible place to live for commoners.  
* Satsuma is actually not that bad, at least compared to Ryukyu. Because they had incentives to develop Okinawa.  
* Japan did even better.  
* Okinawa's history is important/interesting than you think.
