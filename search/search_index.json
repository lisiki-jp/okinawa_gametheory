It's called \"Aid Curse\". (a variant of the Resource Curse) The observation became famous in \"Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa\" by Dambisa Moyo, published in 2009. This book fundamentally changed the public debate on development by arguing that systemic government-to-government aid has been a \"curse\" rather than a blessing for African countries. This Resource Curse(Aid Curse) doesn't have a single mechanism. It can be economic, political, or ideological reasons. The important point is that what is supposed to be \"good\"(e.g., aid or natural resources) can act as a negative factor for growth.  </p> <p>I'll explain a simplified version that fits for Okinawa case. The mechanism here is that they don't develop industry because they don't have to. Because if aid provides money, why do they have to earn money?  Or even it's better not to develop the economy. Because if they become rich, the aid ends. It's similar to why we Japanese are not excellent at English. Because our economy is big enough for us not to learn a foreign language. We don't have to. So, like we don't learn English, Okinawa doesn't develop industry.  </p> <p>Have you ever heard of the Yubari city economic collapse? That's \"aid curse\" in working. Tokyo sends massive aid to compensate for its energy policy shift that would hurt the coal city. And Yubari spends that money to build the massive tourism infrastructure. But aid was one-time, and the running cost of the tourism facility was on Yubari. And they went bankrupt. If Tokyo didn't send the aid, Yubari didn't crush that hard. This was city-level and short-term. Okinawa is a prefecture-level and has been over 50 years. Yes, Okinawa is Yubari, but worse, and bigger. They haven't gone bankrupt yet because Tokyo is sending our tax money to cover the deficit.  </p> <p>The reason why does Tokyo do this? Tokyo got the switch to ruin Okinawa. It's called \"Soft Budget Constraint\" in economics. \"If you don't obey, I can make you bankrupt by just stopping the aid.\" The money is sent to make Okinawa poor and dependent. So Tokyo can control Okinawa.

Today, Okinawa has the curse of the aid from Tokyo. Ryukyu had that as the aid from Ming. From the Ryukyu kings' (1429 - 1609) perspective, population is not a good resource. Weapon/wealth comes from the Ming(aid curse). Which will not be affected by how many people you have. The local industries matter for the King (for Ming) has a small employment cap. For example, Iwo-Tori-Shima's sulfur deposit(resource curse). If the king can fit the people on the deposit, the extra population has no benefit for maximizing his wealth. He had a highly profitable, low operational cost business. It's even better not to have a large population. Because it causes the undesirable power balance shift of King vs. Others. Keeping the population small and weak is the optimal choice for the King. This is symbolized by the weapon confiscation by the Ryukyu kings.  He can secure his power by keeping the population small and weak, and maximizing the aid from the Ming by maximizing the goods flow(mainly sulfur) to the Ming, which can be done without the local people's labor. Trade(which is enabled by Ming) is the same; they don't need labor.  In short, Ryukyu's low growth rate (0.11%) is the result of the resource/aid curse. This is a usual behavior of \"Rentier State Autocrat\".  </p> <p>Ryukyu/Satsuma(1609 \u2013 1880) period, Satsuma wanted to create a sugar industry in Ryukyu, which needed manpower to run.

Ryukyu/Satsuma Era: The \"Head Tax\" (Nint\u014dzei) Penalty While Satsuma demanded the tribute, it was the Ryukyu Kingdom (Shuri) that designed the collection system. Acting as a colonial power toward its own periphery, the Shuri government protected the Main Island peasantry by shifting the heaviest fiscal burden onto the \"culturally distinct\" Sakishima Islands. The Mechanism: The Head Tax (Nint\u014dzei) charged a fixed amount per person, regardless of harvest success. The Incentive: This turned every child into a Fixed Liability. In a region plagued by typhoons, a new mouth to feed was a guaranteed debt that threatened the family's solvency. The Result: To survive, families were forced into infanticide (Mabiki*). The tax system acted as a structural \"population brake,\" compelling the poor to cull their own numbers to mitigate the risk passed down from Shuri.  </p> <p>2. Japan Era: The Shift from Liability to Asset The Meiji government eventually abolished the Head Tax (fully by 1903) and replaced it with a modern Land Tax. The Reform: Taxation was no longer based on existence, but on land value. The Incentive: This reversed the economic logic of the family. A child transformed from a \"Tax Object\" into a Labor Asset. More children meant more hands to work the sugar cane fields, increasing the family's surplus income. The Boom:* With the state no longer penalizing reproduction, the population naturally corrected upward.

These were true Trading Kingdoms. Which thrived because of trade. Trade is the lifeline. They have to protect it.  </p> <p>Ryukyu had no standing navy. They were not \"moving goods\" through their own commercial power; they were moving goods because China allowed them to.  </p> <p>And Ryukyu didn't thrive.  They claim they did, but a thriving trading kingdom would never be defeated by financially broken Satsuma by naval invasion. Mongol invasions failed because that was a naval invasion. Even the strongest empire at that time couldn't succeed it. The defense side has a massive advantage. It is considered the most difficult type of military campaign. And trade kingdom is best at naval warfare. It just doesn't make sense.  </p> <p>In fact, Japan at that time was much better qualified as a \"Trade Kingdom\". When the Portuguese in Macau killed Japanese sailors in the \"Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a incident\" (1610), the Daimyo Arima Harunobu blockaded the harbor, attacked the Portuguese ship for days, and blew it up. This is what a Trading Kingdom looks like. A country with no navy can't do business overseas; that's the reality.  </p> <p>Ryukyu was \"allowed\" to trade because China let them. Ryukyu was a Dejima of the Ming. Okinawa government's official story ignores that fact.  </p> <p>And people started to ignore the ban; Ryukyu lost its role as a warehouse. The Okinawa Government calls it the \"Great Trade Era.\" A more accurate name would be the \"Great Warehouse Era.\"</p>"},{"location":"01_Analysis/06_history-okinawa/#plausible-deniability-of-for-child-on-prefokinawajp","title":"\"Plausible deniability\" of \"for child\" on pref.okinawa.jp","text":"<p>We did just 2 lines.

The official story is a fantasy.  </p> <p>Let's move to meta-analysis.  </p> <p>Okinawa gov's page was the first result on Google when I searched \"\u6c96\u7e04 \u6b74\u53f2\". And the Okinawa government's page seems relatively new; it's from 2024.  They created this page recently. It's safe to say they want to push this narrative.  </p> <p>If you are keen, you realized the URL of the page has \"kodomo\" in it. Yes, officially, the page is for a \"child\".  </p> <p>So you might think that \"inaccuracy is because the page is designed for children\". It's a good point.  </p> <p>The Okinawa government actually has pages for \"adult\" too. You can't reach that page from Google by the usual \"\u6c96\u7e04 \u6b74\u53f2\". You have to search \"site:pref.okinawa.jp \u6b74\u53f2\" The terrifying first half is just telling Google to search from the Okinawa prefecture website. This proves two things: 1. Inaccessibility: No normal person will ever find the \"Adult\" page. 2. SEO Manipulation: The \"Child\" page is designed to be the only result everyone sees.  </p> <p>Here is the link. It was created in 2024(at least that they claim), the same as a \"Child\" version. \"\u6c96\u7e04\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6587\u53168\" https://archive.is/UwAT1</p> <p>Don't worry. That's the right page. You are seeing the right page.  It's just a picture of trees, you think. Yes, it's just a picture of trees, I think.  </p> <p>You see, \"adult\" history pages are low-quality pictures. It's from the book \"\u6c96\u7e04\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u6587\u5316\" published in 2000/3/31 by \u6c96\u7e04\u770c\u6559\u80b2\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a One picture = one page = one webpage. Total 81 pages. There is zero text data. Just images. As a former Web Engineer (SRE), this is one of the worst implementations I have ever seen. It is what we call \"Anti-SEO\" design.  </p> <p>\"Anti-SEO\" means the content structure is so terrible that search engines (e.g., Google) do not prefer to list the page. \"Anti-SEO\" is useful when the website owner satisfies these 3 conditions at the same time. 1. They are legally(or any reason) required to publish the page. 2. Wants to hide the page from public view  3. Don't want to totally block the search engine. (which would be too obvious)</p> <p>And from the perspective of Accessibility (a11y), the Okinawa Government is violating guidelines.  Government websites are legally required to be accessible to the blind. (JIS X 8341-3) The pictures can't be read by screen readers. This also helps to score the webpage as not preferred by Google.  </p> <p>You see how Okinawa prefecture has archived the practically inaccessible history pages for the \"adult\" by design. \"Child\" page is a good SEO design(it's well structured text, URL is an official Japanese prefecture), where everyone comes. And because usually Google search lists only one page from one domain, if the \"Child\" page has relatively good SEO, it will be the only page Google lists.  </p> <p>** So, why do they do this?** This is a tactic called \"plausible deniability\" in politics. Or just \"deniability\" for short. By creating the practically inaccessible \"adult\" page with accurate history, they can shield themselves from criticism for the \"child\" page being inaccurate. Work like this. 1. A professor criticizes the webpage for inaccuracy. 2. The Okinawa government says, \"It's for children, we have an accurate version for adults too!\" So they can spread the inaccurate history while being immune to criticism.  </p> <p>No normal person will reach the accurate version.

Who pays? The rental car companies? No. The luxury hotels? No. You do.. The local tax revenue cannot cover it. So, Okinawa must beg Tokyo for more subsidies to repair the bridge.

So let's target the wealthy. Let's be like Hawaii.\" So many problems here, one is that Hawaii is too close; Okinawa has to compete with Hawaii if it chooses this path. And the real problem is much deeper and dangerous.  </p> <p>I have studied the history and economy of Hawaii extensively. On the surface, it looks like a paradise of success. But the reality for Native Hawaiians is a nightmare. Hawaii's prosperity is a statistical illusion of \"average\".  Compared to Hawaii, Okinawa looks like paradise. I mean it. Okinawa has hope, that's why I'm writing this. Native Hawaiian has no hope.  </p> <p>In Hawaii, the people who can trace their roots to the Kingdom have been reduced to a statistical minority on their own islands. Hawaii is not something Okinawa wants to pursue.  </p> <p>In Hawaii, an unmixed-blood Hawaiian dies, on average, 22 years earlier than the outsiders who own the mansions next door.  Wealthy residents in top-tier US zip codes (like Kahala, part of Maui) live about 90 years. Unmixed-blood Hawaiians live about 68 years. 90 - 68 = 22 Years. Why? Because \"Luxury Tourism\" makes the cost of living lethal. They cannot afford healthy food. They cannot afford healthcare. They cannot afford to buy a home on the land their ancestors walked on.  </p> <p>Look at the population data from history. When outsiders invaded, the Hawaiian Kingdom had a population eight times larger than the Ryukyu Kingdom. (Hawaii 1778: about 650K; Okinawa 1609: about 78K(exclude Amami)) Today, 1.4 million Okinawans live on the island. Okinawans are thriving on the island where their ancestors lived.  2020 U.S. Census, only 0.2 million people identified as \"Native Hawaiian alone.\" Remember? They had an 8 times larger population than Ryukyu.  </p> <p>Things get darker.  \"The Office of Hawaiian Affairs\u2019 (OHA) Native Hawaiian Data Book\" https://ohadatabook.com/Quantum-01.pdf In 1984, only 8,244 were counted as \"100% Hawaiian\". Given the high rates of intermarriage and the aging of that specific generation, demographers and organizations generally estimate that this number has dropped below 8,000 in the decades since. The estimated unmixed blood native Hawaiian population today is \"Fewer than 8,000\". </p> <p>\"Fewer than 8,000\"</p> <p>Now you know what I meant. Okinawa looks like paradise compared to Hawaii.  </p> <p>You might think I'm weirdly obsessive about unmixed blood. It's because the US has a law to qualify a person's ethnicity by how thick one's blood is. Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). To qualify for a homestead lease, an applicant must prove they have at least 50% Native Hawaiian blood. They are trying to make Native Hawaiians \"legally not Native Hawaiian\"; this pressure exists in many forms in Hawaii, and the result is the \"Fewer than 8,000\". The system is designed to define them out of existence. If you can't afford to live there, you leave. If you mix with others, the government says you aren't 'Native' enough to claim your land. It is an assimilation machine with extra steps.  </p> <p>If we succeed at 'Luxury tourism,' Okinawa just become Hawaii, where the locals can't afford to live anymore.  Is that the dream?

Real estate prices skyrocket to match the \"Global Standard.\" 3.  The cost of living becomes impossible for a local family. 4.  The locals are forced to leave the island to survive. 5.
